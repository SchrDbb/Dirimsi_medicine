                <h3>Case Description</h3>
                <p>A mother brings her 12-month-old child, a new patient for your clinic, for a well-child visit. The infant appears to be small for her age. Her weight is below the 5th percentile on standardized growth curves (50th percentile for an 8-month-old), her length is at the 25th percentile, and her head circumference is at the 50th percentile. Her vital signs and her examination otherwise are normal.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What is the next step in the management of this patient?</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>What is the most likely diagnosis?</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>What is the next step in the evaluation?</strong></li>

                <h3>Answers</h3>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 12-month-old girl has poor weight gain, but no etiology is found on examination.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Next step:</strong> Gather more information, including birth, past medical, family, social, and developmental histories. A dietary history is especially important.</li>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Failure to thrive (FTT), most likely “nonorganic” in etiology.</li>
                    <li><strong>Next step in evaluation:</strong> Limited screening laboratory testing to identify organic causes of FTT, dietary counseling, and frequent office visits to assess weight gain.</li>

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Know the historical clues necessary to recognize organic and nonorganic FTT.</li>
                    <li>Understand the appropriate use of the laboratory in a healthy child with FTT.</li>
                    <li>Appreciate the treatment and follow-up of a child with nonorganic FTT.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Considerations</h4>
                <p>This patient’s growth pattern (inadequate weight gain, potentially modest length retardation, and head circumference sparing) suggests FTT, most likely nonorganic given that the examination is normal. A nonorganic FTT diagnosis is made after organic etiologies are excluded, and, after adequate nutrition and an adequate environment is assured, growth resumes normally after catch-up growth is demonstrated. Diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers aimed at organic causes are appropriate when supported by the history (prematurity, maternal infection) or examination (enlarged spleen, significant developmental delay). Although organic and nonorganic FTT can occur simultaneously, attempts to differentiate the two forms are helpful because the evaluation, treatment, and follow-up may be very different.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Had the same practitioner followed this patient since birth or had previous records from the previous health-care provider, earlier detection of FTT and its potential etiology with rapid intervention might have occurred. For instance, patients with poor caloric intake usually fail to gain weight but maintain length and head circumference. As nutrition remains poor, length becomes affected next and then ultimately head circumference.</p>

                <h3>Approach to Failure to Thrive</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <dl>
                    <dt>FAILURE TO THRIVE (FTT):</dt>
                    <dd>A physical sign, not a final diagnosis. It is suspected when growth is below the third or fifth percentile or crosses more than two major growth percentiles in a short time frame. Usually seen in children younger than 5 years whose physical growth is significantly less than that of their peers.</dd>
                    <dt>NONORGANIC (PSYCHOSOCIAL) FTT:</dt>
                    <dd>Poor growth without a medical etiology. Nonorganic FTT often is related to poverty or poor caregiver–child interaction. It constitutes one-third to one-half of FTT cases identified in tertiary care settings and nearly all cases in primary care settings.</dd>
                    <dt>ORGANIC FTT:</dt>
                    <dd>Poor growth caused by an underlying medical condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease, renal disease, or congenital heart conditions.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>The goals of the history, physical examination, and laboratory testing are to establish whether the child’s caregiver is supplying enough calories, whether the child is consuming enough calories, and whether the child is able to use the calories for growth. Identification of which factor is the likely source of problem helps guide management.</p>
                <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
                <p>The history and physical examination are the most important tools in an FTT evaluation. A dietary history can offer important clues to identify an etiology. The type of milk (breast or bottle) and frequency and quality of feeding, voiding, vomiting, and stooling should be recorded. The milk used (commercial or homemade formula) and the mixing process (to ensure appropriate dilution) should be reviewed (adding too much water to powdered formula results in inadequate nutrition). The amount and type of juices and solid foods should be noted for older children. Significant food aversions might suggest gastric distress of malabsorption. A two-week food diary (the parent notes all foods offered and taken by the child) and any associated symptoms of sweating, choking, cyanosis, difficulty sucking, and the like can be useful.</p>
                <p>Pregnancy and early neonatal histories may reveal maternal infection, depression, drug use, intrauterine growth retardation, prematurity, or other chronic neonatal conditions. When children suspected of having FTT are seen in families whose members are genetically small or with a slow growth history (constitutional delay), affected children are usually normal and do not require an exhaustive evaluation. In contrast, a family history of inheritable disease associated with poor growth (cystic fibrosis) should be evaluated more extensively. Because nonorganic FTT is more commonly associated with poverty, a social history is often useful. The child’s living arrangements, including primary and secondary caregivers, housing type, caregiver’s financial and employment status, the family’s social supports, and unusual stresses (such as spousal abuse) should be reviewed. While gathering the history, the clinician can observe for unusual caregiver–child interactions.</p>
                <p>All body organ systems potentially harbor a cause for organic FTT (Table 1–1). The developmental status (possibly delayed in organic and nonorganic FTT) needs evaluation. Children with nonorganic FTT may demonstrate an occipital bald spot from lying in a bed and failure to attain appropriate developmental milestones resulting from lack of parental stimulation; may be disinterested in their environment; may avoid eye contact, smiling, or vocalization; and may not respond well to maternal attempts of comforting. Children with some types of organic FTT (renal tubular acidosis) and most nonorganic FTT show “catch-up” in developmental milestones with successful therapy. During the examination (especially of younger infants) the clinician can observe a feeding, which may give clues to maternal–child interaction bonding issues or to physical problems (cerebral palsy, oral motor or swallowing difficulties, velum cleft palate).</p>
                <p>The history or examination suggestive of organic FTT directs the laboratory and radiologic evaluation. In most cases, results of the newborn state screen are critical. A child with cystic fibrosis in the family requires sweat chloride or genetic testing. A child with a loud, harsh systolic murmur and bounding pulses deserves a chest radiograph, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and perhaps an echocardiogram and cardiology consult. Most FTT children have few or no signs. Thus, laboratory evaluation is usually limited to a few screening tests: a complete blood count (CBC), lead level (especially for patients in lower socioeconomic classes or in cities with a high lead prevalence), urinalysis and culture, and serum electrolyte levels (including calcium, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], and creatinine). A tuberculosis skin test and human immunodeficiency virus testing may also be indicated. Abnormalities in screening tests are pursued more extensively.</p>

                <h4>Treatment and Follow-up</h4>
                <p>The treatment and follow-up for organic FTT is disease specific. Patients with nonorganic FTT are managed with improved dietary intake, close follow-up, and attention to psychosocial issues.</p>
                <p>Healthy infants in the first year of life require approximately 120 kcal/kg/d of nutrition and about 100 kcal/kg/d thereafter; FTT children require an additional 50% to 100% to ensure adequate catch-up growth. A mealtime routine is important. Families should eat together in a nondistracting environment (television off!), with meals lasting between 20 and 30 minutes. Solid foods are offered before liquids; children are not force-fed. Low-calorie drinks, juices, and water are limited; age-appropriate high-calorie foods (whole milk, cheese, dried fruits, peanut butter) are encouraged. Formulas containing more than the standard 20 cal/oz may be necessary for smaller children, and high-calorie supplementation (PediaSure or Ensure) may be required for larger children. Frequent office or home health visits are indicated to ensure weight gain. In some instances, hospitalization of an FTT child is required; such infants often have rapid weight gain, supporting the diagnosis of nonorganic FTT.</p>
                <p>Nonorganic FTT treatment requires not only the provision of increased calories but also attention to contributing psychosocial issues. Referral to community services (Women, Infants, and Children [WIC] Program, Food Stamp Program, and local food banks) may be required. Caregiver help in the form of job training, substance and physical abuse prevention, parenting classes, and psychotherapy may be available through community programs. Older children and their families may benefit from early childhood intervention and Head Start programs.</p>
                <p>Some children with organic FTT also have nonorganic FTT. For instance, a poorly growing special-needs premature infant is at increased risk for superimposed nonorganic FTT because of psychosocial issues, such as poor bonding with the family during a prolonged hospital stay. In such cases, care for the organic causes is coordinated with attempts to preclude nonorganic FTT.</p>

                    <li>A 4-month-old child has poor weight gain. Her current weight is less than the 5th percentile, height about the 10th percentile, and head circumference at the 50th percentile. The planned pregnancy resulted in a normal, spontaneous, vaginal delivery; mother and child were discharged after a 48-hour hospitalization. Feeding is via breast and bottle; the quantity seems sufficient. The child has had no illness. The examination is unremarkable except for the child’s small size. Screening laboratory shows the hemoglobin and hematocrit are 11 mg/dL and 33%, respectively, with a platelet count of 198,000/mm³. Serum electrolyte levels are sodium 140, chloride 105, potassium 3.5, bicarbonate 17, blood urea nitrogen 15, and creatinine 0.3. Liver function tests are normal. Urinalysis reveals a pH of 8 with occasional epithelial cells but no white blood cells, bacteria, protein, ketones, or reducing substances.

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>C.</strong> The expected weight versus age must be modified for a preterm infant. Similarly, growth for children with Down or Turner syndrome varies from that for other children. Thus, use of an appropriate growth curve is paramount. For the child in the question, weight gain should follow or exceed that of term infants. For this premature infant, when his parameters are plotted on a “premie growth chart,” normal growth is revealed.</li>
                    <li><strong>A.</strong> The developmental delay, intrauterine growth retardation (including microcephaly), cataracts, seizures, hepatosplenomegaly, prolonged neonatal jaundice, and purpura at birth are consistent with a congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) or toxoplasmosis infection. Calcified brain density of CMV typically are found in a periventricular pattern; in toxoplasmosis, they are found scattered throughout the cortex.</li>
                    <li><strong>C.</strong> Between 18 and 30 months of age children often become “picky eaters.” Their growth rate can slow, and the period can be distressing for families. Calm counseling of parents to provide nutrition, avoid “force-feeding,” and avoid providing snacks is usually effective. Close follow-up is required.</li>
                    <li><strong>E.</strong> The patient has evidence of renal tubular acidosis (probably distal tubular), a well-described cause of FTT. Upon confirmation of the findings, oral bicarbonate supplementation would be expected to correct the elevated chloride level, the low bicarbonate and potassium levels (although potassium supplements may be required), and poor growth.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>In the United States, psychosocial failure to thrive is more common than organic failure to thrive; it often is associated with poverty or poor parent–child interaction.</li>
                    <li>Inexpensive laboratory screening tests, dietary counseling, and close observation of weight changes are appropriate first steps for most healthy-appearing infants with failure to thrive.</li>
                    <li>Organic failure to thrive can be associated with abnormalities of any organ system. Clues in history, examination, or screening laboratory tests help identify affected organ systems.</li>
                    <li>Up to one-third of patients with psychosocial failure to thrive have developmental delay as well as social and emotional problems.</li>
                    <li>Patients with renal tubular acidosis, a common cause of organic failure to thrive, can have proximal tubule defects (type 2) caused by impaired tubular bicarbonate reabsorption or distal tubule defects (type 1) caused by impaired hydrogen ion secretion. Type 4 is also a distal tubule problem associated with impaired ammoniagenesis.</li>

            <article id="case2-description">
                <h3>Case Description</h3>
                <p>A healthy 16-year-old adolescent male arrives at your office with his parents, who are concerned about his several months’ history of erratic behavior. At times he has a great deal more energy, decreased appetite, and less sleep requirement than usual; at other times he sleeps incessantly and is lethargic. He is doing poorly in school. Last evening he appeared flushed and agitated, he had dilated pupils, and he complained “people were out to get him.” The family notes that he has been skipping school occasionally, and they reluctantly report that he was arrested for burglary 2 weeks previously. You know he is in good health and he previously has been an excellent student. Today he appears normal.</p>

                    <li><strong>What is the most likely diagnosis?</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>What is the next step in the evaluation?</strong></li>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 16-year-old previously healthy adolescent with recent behavior changes and declining school performance.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Drug abuse (probably cocaine, possibly amphetamines).</li>

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Learn the pattern of behavior found among drug-abusing adolescents.</li>
                    <li>Know the signs and symptoms of the more common drugs of abuse.</li>
                    <li>Understand the general approach to therapy for an adolescent abusing drugs.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Considerations</h4>
                <p>Rarely, a brain tumor could explain an adolescent with new onset of behavior changes. In general, however, an adolescent’s new-onset truant behavior, depression, or declining grades is more commonly associated with substance abuse. A previously undiagnosed psychiatric history (mania or bipolar disease), too, must be considered. A history, family history, physical examination (especially the neurologic and psychological portions), and screening laboratory will help provide clarity. Information can come from the patient, his family, or from other interested parties (teachers, coaches, and friends). Direct questioning of the adolescent alone about substance abuse is appropriate during routine health visits or when signs and symptoms are suggestive of abuse.</p>

                <h3>Approach to the Substance-Abusing Adolescent</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <dl>
                    <dt>SUBSTANCE ABUSE:</dt>
                    <dd>Alcohol or other drug use leading to impairment or distress, causing failure of school or work obligations, physical harm, substance-related legal problems, or continued use despite social or interpersonal consequences resulting from the drug’s effects.</dd>
                    <dt>SUBSTANCE DEPENDENCE:</dt>
                    <dd>Alcohol and other drug use, causing loss of control with continued use (tolerance requiring higher doses or withdrawal when terminated), compulsion to obtain and use the drug, and continued use despite persistent or recurrent negative consequences.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>Experimentation with alcohol and other drugs is common among adolescents; some consider this experimentation “normal.” Others argue it is to be avoided because substance abuse is often a cause of adolescent morbidity and mortality (homicide, suicide, and unintentional injuries). In all cases, a health-care provider is responsible for discussing facts about alcohol and drugs in an attempt to reduce the adolescent’s risk of harm and for identifying those requiring intervention.</p>
                <p>Children at risk for drug use include those with significant behavior problems, learning difficulties, and impaired family functioning. Cigarettes and alcohol are the most commonly used drugs; marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug. Some adolescents abuse common household products (inhalation of glue or aerosols); others abuse a sibling’s medications (methylphenidate, which is often snorted with cocaine).</p>
                <p>Pediatricians can ask about alcohol or drug use during the adolescent’s annual health examination or when an adolescent presents with evidence of substance abuse. Direct questions can identify drug or alcohol use and their effect on school performance, family relations, and peer interactions. Should problems be identified, an interview to determine the degree of drug use (experimentation, abuse, or dependency) is warranted.</p>
                <p>Historical clues to drug abuse include significant behavioral changes at home, a decline in school or work performance, or involvement with the law. An increased incidence of intentional or accidental injuries may be alcohol or drug related. Risk-taking activities (trading sex for drugs, driving while impaired) can be particularly serious and may suggest serious drug problems. Alcohol or other drugs users usually have a normal examination, especially if the use was not recent. Needle marks and nasal mucosal injuries are rarely found.</p>
                <p>An adolescent with recent alcohol or drug use can present with a variety of findings (Table 2–1). A urine drug screen (UDS) can be helpful to evaluate the adolescent who (1) presents with psychiatric symptoms, (2) has signs and symptoms commonly attributed to drugs or alcohol, (3) is in a serious accident, or (4) is part of a recovery monitoring program. An attempt to obtain the adolescent’s permission and maintain confidentiality is paramount.</p>

                    <tr><td>Barbiturates</td><td>Sedation, pinpoint pupils, hypotension, bradycardia, hypothermia, hyporeflexia, as well as central nervous system and respiratory depression</td><td>1 d for short-acting agents; 2-3 wk for long-acting agents</td></tr>
                </table>
                <p>Treatment of life-threatening acute problems related to alcohol or drug use follows the ABCs of emergency care: manage the Airway, control Breathing, and assess the Circulation. Treatment then is directed at the offending agent (if known). After stabilization, a treatment plan is devised. For some, inpatient programs that disrupt drug use allow for continued outpatient therapy. For others, an intensive outpatient therapy program can be initiated to help develop a drug-free lifestyle. The expertise necessary to assist an adolescent through these changes is often beyond a general pediatrician’s expertise. Assistance with this chronic problem by qualified health professionals in a developmentally appropriate setting can maximize outcome. Primary care providers can, however, assist families to find suitable community resources.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>E.</strong> PCP is associated with hyperactivity, hallucinations, abusive language, and nystagmus.</li>
                    <li><strong>A.</strong> The adolescent’s permission should be obtained before drug testing. Testing “secretly” in this situation destroys the doctor–patient relationship.</li>
                    <li><strong>C.</strong> Despite previous drug experimentation, his current symptoms and physical findings make drug use a less likely etiology. Evaluation for possible brain tumor is warranted.</li>
                    <li><strong>D.</strong> LSD is associated with symptoms that begin 30 to 60 minutes after ingestion, peak 2 to 4 hours later, and resolve by 10 to 12 hours, including delusional ideation, body distortion, and paranoia. “Bad trips” result in the user becoming terrified or panicked; treatment usually is reassurance of the user in a controlled, safe environment.</li>

                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Know the physical features and problems associated with Down syndrome (DS) and other common trisomy conditions.</li>
                    <li>Understand the evaluation of a child with dysmorphic features consistent with DS.</li>
                    <li>Appreciate the counseling and support required by a family with a special-needs child.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Considerations</h4>
                <p>This newborn has many DS features; confirmation is made with a chromosome evaluation. Upon identification of a child with possible DS, the health-care provider attempts to identify potentially life-threatening features, including cardiac or gastrointestinal (GI) anomalies. A thorough evaluation of the family’s psychosocial environment is warranted; these children can be physically, emotionally, and financially challenging.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> This woman of advanced maternal age had limited prenatal care but was at high risk for pregnancy complications. Adequate care may have included a serum triple screen between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy, which could have demonstrated a DS pattern. Further evaluation (amniocentesis for chromosomal analysis) then could have been offered.</p>

                <h3>Approach to the Dysmorphic Child</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <dl>
                    <dt>ADVANCED MATERNAL AGE:</dt>
                    <dd>The incidence of DS increases each year beyond age 35 years. At 35 years, the incidence is 1 in 378 liveborn infants, increasing to 1 in 106 by age 40 and to 1 in 11 by age 49.</dd>
                    <dt>BRACHYDACTYLY:</dt>
                    <dd>Excessive shortening of hand and foot tubular bones resulting in a boxlike appearance.</dd>
                    <dt>CLINODACTYLY:</dt>
                    <dd>Incurving of one of the digits (in DS the fifth digit curves toward the fourth digit due to midphalanx dysplasia).</dd>
                    <dt>DYSMORPHIC CHILD:</dt>
                    <dd>A child with problems of generalized growth or body structure formation. These children can have a syndrome (a constellation of features from a common cause; ie, DS features caused by extra chromosome 21 material); an association (two or more features of unknown cause occurring together more commonly than expected; ie, VATER [Vertebral problems, Anal anomalies, Trachea problems, Esophageal abnormalities, and Radius or renal anomalies]), or a sequence (a single defect that leads to subsequent abnormalities; ie, Potter disease’s lack of normal infant kidney function, causing reduced urine output, oligohydramnios, and constraint deformities; common facial features include wide-set eyes, flattened palpebral fissures, prominent epicanthus, flattened nasal bridge, mandibular micrognathia, and large, low-set, cartilage-deficient ears).</dd>
                    <dt>SERUM TRISOMY SCREENING:</dt>
                    <dd>Measurements of α-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and estriol levels, usually performed at 15 to 20 weeks’ gestation. These tests screen for a variety of genetic problems. Approximately 60% of DS babies and 80% to 90% of the babies with neural tube defects will be identified by this testing.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>The first newborn evaluation occurs in the delivery room where attempts are made to successfully transition the infant from an intrauterine to an extrauterine environment; it focuses primarily on the ABCs of medicine—Airway, Breathing, and Circulation. The infant is then evaluated for possible abnormalities, including those that might fit into a pattern such as DS.</p>
                <p>The prenatal history and course provide some important clues in the evaluation of a dysmorphic child. The parents’ age (increased chromosomal abnormalities with increased maternal and sometimes paternal age), degree of fetal movement, maternal drug or teratogen exposure, family history of dysmorphia, and prenatal testing results, including triple screening and chorioamnionic or chorionic villous testing, may prove helpful. For instance, an older mother with a low AFP on her triple screen is at higher risk for having a DS child.</p>
                <p>The physical examination is critical to the diagnosis of a dysmorphic child. For DS, a distinctive pattern can lead to a presumptive diagnosis; more than 90% of such children have features, including upslanting palpebral fissures, Brushfield spots (white or grey spots in the periphery of the iris), flat facial profile; small and rounded ears; excess nuchal skin, widespread nipples, pelvic dysplasia, joint hyperflexibility, fifth finger clinodactyly, a single transverse palmar (simian) crease, hypotonia, and a poor Moro reflex. Other features include brachycephaly (disproportionate shortness of the head), epicanthal folds, brachydactyly, wide spacing between first and second toes, and short stature.</p>
                <p>In newborns with suspected DS, at least two potentially life-threatening conditions must be addressed. Approximately 50% of DS infants have cardiac defects—most commonly an endocardial cushion defect (60%), ventricular septal defect (VSD, 32%), and tetralogy of Fallot (6%). A cardiology consultation and echocardiogram usually are indicated. Approximately 12% of DS infants have intestinal (usually duodenal) atresia, some presenting with a history of polyhydramnios. All DS infants have hypotonia and sometimes slower feeding. Should an infant with presumed DS develop persistent vomiting after feeds (especially if bilious), an upper GI study likely will reveal the characteristic “double-bubble” pattern of duodenal atresia; surgical intervention is warranted.</p>
                <p>Confirmation of DS requires chromosomal analysis. A complete, extra chromosome 21 (nondisjunction, ie, failure to segregate during meiosis) occurs in almost 95% of cases. Two percent of cases are caused by translocations (breakage and removal of a large DNA segment from one chromosome and attachment to a different one), and 3% are mosaics (more than one cell type; usually described as an abnormal cell percentage). Parents of translocation-caused DS are evaluated for chromosomal aberrations; the recurrence risk can approach 100% in some cases.</p>
                <p>Other newborn conditions associated with DS include hearing loss, strabismus, cataracts, nystagmus, and congenital hypothyroidism. Hearing is evaluated by age 3 months. An ophthalmologist evaluates the eyes by age 6 months, and thyroid function is assessed as part of the routine newborn screening program. Longer-term DS consequences include a higher leukemia risk, acquired hypothyroidism, atlantoaxial (cervical spine) instability, and premature aging with an increased risk of Alzheimer disease. All DS children are mentally retarded, but the intelligence quotients vary widely (mosaics can exhibit near-normal intelligence).</p>
                <p>“Well-child care” takes on special meaning for DS children. In addition to providing routine care based on the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for health supervision that apply to all children, the AAP has promulgated DS-specific guidelines (see www.aap.org). Periodic objective thyroid, hearing, and vision screenings are focal points of concern. Equally important in successful DS management is appropriate psychosocial intervention. Proper home or environmental, educational, and vocational interventions can improve the DS child’s functioning level, facilitating his or her transition to adulthood. Providing family support and assisting with financial and medical support program applications are within the pediatrician’s realm.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>B.</strong> The child has trisomy 18. Other features include clenched hands with overlapping digits, small palpebral fissures, prominent occiput, short sternum, and cardiac defects (ventricular septal defect [VSD], atrial septal defect [ASD], patent ductus arteriosus [PDA], or coarctation of the aorta).</li>
                    <li><strong>A.</strong> Although VSDs are common in DS, the most characteristic lesion is endocardial cushion defect (or atrioventricular [AV] canal defect). Slight cyanosis occurs because of the mixing of deoxygenated with oxygenated blood. In the AV canal, a range of defects involving the atrial septum, the ventricular septum, and one or both of the AV valves can be seen. A complete AV canal includes ASDs and VSDs with a common AV valve. A partial AV canal includes defects of the atrial septum and separate mitral and tricuspid valve orifices.</li>
                    <li><strong>D.</strong> The appearance of cutis aplasia and polydactyly suggests trisomy 13. Other common features include holoprosencephaly (failure of growth of the forebrain), cleft lip or palate, postaxial polydactyly, flexed and overlapping fingers, coloboma, and cardiac defects (VSD, ASD, PDA, dextrocardia).</li>
                    <li><strong>C.</strong> Until lateral cervical flexion–extension films confirm normal anatomy, contact sports and other activities that may result in forceful flexion of the neck should be avoided.</li>

                <h3>Case Description</h3>
                <p>An 8-year-old boy presents to your clinic with a 3-day history of a “white coating” in his mouth. He denies having a sore throat, upper respiratory infection symptoms, gastrointestinal (GI) distress, change in appetite, or fever. His immunizations are current, he has no significant past medical history, and he has been developing normally per his mother. His weight, however, has fallen from the 25th percentile to the 5th percentile, and he has been hospitalized on three occasions in the last year with pneumonia or dehydration. His family history is remarkable only for maternal hepatitis C infection related to past intravenous (IV) drug use. The patient is afebrile today, but his examination is notable for severe gingivitis, bilateral cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, exudates on his buccal mucosa, and hepatomegaly.</p>

                <h3>Approach to the Child with Immunodeficiency</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <dl>

                    <dd>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening for HIV-1 immunoglobulin G (IgG); initially detectable 2 weeks to 6 months after exposure; sensitivity and specificity greater than 99%; false-positive rate less than 5 in 100,000 assays; false-negative results may occur after immunization or in hepatic disease, autoimmune disease, or advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</dd>
                    <dt>WESTERN BLOT:</dt>
                    <dd>Direct visualization of antibodies to virion proteins; used to confirm screening antibody assay; results can be indeterminate and require repeat testing.</dd>
                    <dt>CD4 (T HELPER) CELL:</dt>
                    <dd>Essential for humoral (B-cell) and cellular (T-cell) immunity; binds to antigens presented by B cells, prompting antibody production, and to antigens presented by phagocytes, prompting lymphokine release; rendered dysfunctional in HIV infection.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>Evaluation of patients with recurring or atypical infection starts with a comprehensive history and systems review. Clinicians should inquire about perinatal history, growth and development, and past illnesses. Immunosuppression is suggested by failure to thrive (FTT) or atypical or difficult-to-eradicate infections (recurring otitis refractory to multiple antimicrobials). Family history includes parental health concerns (unexplained weight loss, growth failure, or developmental delay in siblings) and recurring or atypical infection in immediate family members. A focused physical examination should then be performed to identify signs consistent with immunosuppression (wasting, generalized lymphadenopathy, and organomegaly).</p>
                <p>Primary (syndromic) immunodeficiency is due to a genetic defect, either inherited or related to gene mutation; most are humoral in origin or characterized by both humoral and cellular dysfunction (severe combined immunodeficiency). Other primary immunodeficiencies include phagocytic cell deficiency (chronic granulomatous disease due to defective macrophages) and complement deficiency (autoimmune disease or serious bacterial infection due to C2 deficiency). Patients with secondary immunodeficiency have normal immune function at birth, but subsequently develop an illness or metabolic abnormality that disrupts immune cell production or function. Conditions adversely affecting a patient’s immune status include HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, hepatic disease, autoimmune disease (scleroderma), aging, and stress.</p>
                <p>HIV is a global epidemic, with approximately 33 million people presumably infected worldwide. Unprotected sexual intercourse and needle sharing with IV drug use are known means of transmission. Prior to the mid-1980s, blood transfusion was also a risk factor. In the pediatric population, HIV is typically acquired through vertical transmission. Approximately 80% of pediatric cases involve intrapartum transfer, but HIV can also be acquired from infected secretions at delivery and from breast milk. It is important to know the HIV status of the pregnant female, so that antiretroviral therapy can be administered during pregnancy to decrease viral replication and diminish the potential for transfer to the neonate. An infected mother has a 25% chance of transmitting the virus to her newborn if antiretroviral therapy is not received during pregnancy. Zidovudine, when started by the mother during the second trimester and given to the baby through age 6 weeks, reduces the risk of HIV transmission to less than 10%.</p>
                <p>HIV infection gives rise to dysfunctional CD4 cells resulting in overall immune system compromise and eventual opportunistic infection. Approximately 75% of pediatric patients who acquire HIV vertically follow a course similar to adults, with an extended period of disease inactivity; a patient will often remain asymptomatic for a decade or more until the CD4 count falls to a critical level. The remaining 25% of pediatric HIV patients progress rapidly during the first several months of life. Therefore, early determination of maternal HIV status and measures to decrease transmission is critical (avoiding breast-feeding, aggressive and appropriate neonatal HIV testing, early antiretroviral therapy).</p>
                <p>Verification of HIV infection is made in the patient older than 18 months by performing an HIV antibody ELISA and subsequent Western blot for confirmation. Because of placental transfer of maternal antibodies, diagnosis in younger patients is made by HIV DNA PCR testing. Two assays are performed on separate occasions to confirm the diagnosis. Subsequently, HIV RNA activity, CD4 cell count, and clinical findings are used to determine disease status. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classification of HIV status is based on the presence and severity of signs or symptoms and degree of immunosuppression. For example, a patient with Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia (PCP), an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection, is classified with “severe” disease (category C). Degree of immunosuppression is based on an age-adjusted CD4 count. For the patient in this case, a normal CD4 count would be more than or equal to 500 or 25%. Severe suppression is denoted by a CD4 count less than 200 or 15%.</p>
                <p>Neonates born to HIV-positive women are tested at birth and at selected intervals through approximately 6 months of age. Traditionally, the exposed neonate receives 6 weeks of antiretroviral therapy in the form of zidovudine starting in the first few hours of life. PCP prophylaxis in the form of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole commences at approximately 6 weeks of age for HIV-positive infants. CD4 levels are followed in quarterly intervals in the patient who becomes HIV-positive. HIV RNA activity is followed and typically correlates with disease progression; RNA activity of more than 100,000 copies/mL has been associated with advanced progression and early death.</p>
                <p>Treatment for HIV-positive patients is started early to diminish viral replication before mutation and antiretroviral resistance occur. The three major classes of antiretrovirals are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (didanosine, stavudine, zidovudine), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (efavirenz, nevirapine), and protease inhibitors (indinavir, nelfinavir). Combination retroviral therapy in children has led to a marked decline in child mortality. Common adverse effects for all include headache, emesis, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Osteopenia and drug rash can also be seen. Possible other abnormalities include anemia, neutropenia, elevated transaminases, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia.</p>
                <p>The current pediatric antiretroviral therapy recommendation consists of three drugs: two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and one protease inhibitor. An existing treatment regimen is altered when toxicity becomes an issue or disease progression occurs. Ultimately, HIV treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach with input from nutritionists, social workers, and pediatric HIV and mental health specialists. In addition to periodic monitoring of viral activity and prophylaxis against opportunistic infection, close monitoring of growth, development, and emotional health is important in pediatric HIV disease management. Immunizations should be kept current, with all vaccines administered per the recommended pediatric schedule, often excluding live vaccines such as measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and varicella.</p>

                    <li><strong>A.</strong> The obese adolescent in this case has findings of diabetes mellitus. Her cutaneous candidiasis is likely an indication of secondary immunosuppression related to hyperglycemia. In diabetes, hyperglycemia promotes neutrophil dysfunction, and circulatory insufficiency contributes to ineffective neutrophil chemotaxis during infection. HIV infection is possible and antibody testing might be reasonable, but this scenario is most consistent with hyperglycemia.</li>
                    <li><strong>C.</strong> You suspect leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) as the etiology of this child’s problem. LAD is an inheritable disorder of leukocyte chemotaxis and adherence characterized by recurring sinopulmonary, oropharyngeal, and cutaneous infections with delayed wound healing. Neutrophilia is common with WBC counts of typically more than 50,000 cells/mm³. Severe, life-threatening infection is possible with Staphylococcus species, Enterobacteriaceae, and Candida species. Good skin and oral hygiene are important; broad-spectrum antimicrobials and surgical debridement are early considerations with infection.</li>
                    <li><strong>C.</strong> SCID is an autosomal recessive or X-linked disorder of both humoral and cellular immunity. Serum immunoglobulins and T cells are often markedly diminished or absent. Thymic dysgenesis is also seen. Recurring cutaneous, gastrointestinal, or pulmonary infections occur with opportunistic organisms such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and PCP. Death typically occurs in the first 12 to 24 months of life unless bone marrow transplantation is performed.</li>
                    <li><strong>B.</strong> DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a 22q11 microdeletion. This syndromic immunodeficiency is characterized by decreased T-cell production and recurring infection. Findings include characteristic facies and velocardiofacial defects such as ventricular septal defect and tetralogy of Fallot. Thymic or parathyroid dysgenesis can occur, accompanied by hypocalcemia and seizures. Developmental

            <h2>Case 6: Megaloblastic Anemia</h2>
            <div class="case-content">
                <h3>Case Description</h3>
                <p>A 6-month-old child arrives for a well-child examination. His family recently moved to the United States from Turkey. His medical and family histories are unremarkable except that his sole source of nutrition is goat’s milk. He appears to be healthy on examination.</p>
                <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What hematologic problem is most likely to develop?</li>
                    <li>What nonhematologic concerns are considered in an infant fed goat’s milk?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Answers</h3>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This is a 6-month-old child exclusively fed goat’s milk.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely complication:</strong> Megaloblastic anemia from folate or B12 deficiency.</p>
                <p><strong>Other concerns:</strong> Brucellosis if milk is unpasteurized.</p>

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Appreciate the benefits of breast-feeding.</li>
                    <li>Know the nutritional supplements recommended for breast-feeding mothers.</li>
                    <li>Understand the special needs of infants and toddlers fed goat’s milk or vegan diets.</li>
                    <li>Appreciate the clinical syndromes resulting from vitamin excesses and deficiencies.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> A variety of feeding regimens exist for infants and toddlers—breast-feeding, goat’s milk, other types of nonformula milk, and commercial or handmade foods. Health care providers can educate parents about the benefits and potential dangers of various diet choices.</p>

                <h3>Approach to Infant Nutrition</h3>
                <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lactovegetarian:</strong> Diet devoid of animal products but includes milk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Omnivore:</strong> Diet includes both animal and vegetable products.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ovovegetarian:</strong> Diet devoid of animal products but includes eggs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vegan:</strong> Vegetarian diet devoid of all animal products.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Clinical Approach:</strong> Infant formulas containing goat’s milk are not routinely available in the United States, but they are available elsewhere. Goat’s milk has lower sodium levels but more potassium, chloride, linoleic acid, and arachidonic acid than does cow’s milk. It is low in vitamin D, iron, folate, and vitamin B12; infants receiving goat’s milk as a primary nutrition source are given folate and vitamin B12 (to prevent megaloblastic anemia) and iron (to prevent iron deficiency anemia). Goat’s milk is boiled before ingestion; goats are particularly susceptible to brucellosis.</p>
                <p>Breast milk is considered the ideal human infant food because it contains complete nutrition (with the possible exception of vitamin D and fluoride), has antimicrobial properties, and offers psychological advantages to mothers and infants. In developing countries, it is associated with lower infant morbidity and mortality, not only due to a reduction in diarrhea associated with contaminated water used in formula preparation but also because it contains high concentrations of immunoglobulin A (IgA), which reduces viruses and bacteria intestinal wall adherence, and macrophages, which inhibit Escherichia coli growth. Disadvantages include potential HIV (and other virus) transmission, jaundice exacerbation due to increased unconjugated bilirubinemia levels (resolved with a 12- to 24-hour breast-feeding interruption) and its association with low vitamin K levels, contributing to hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (prevented by vitamin K administration at birth).</p>
                <p>Formula feeding is substituted for breast-feeding for a variety of reasons. Commercial formula manufacturers strive to provide products similar to human milk. Infant growth rates with cow’s milk formula are similar to those in infants receiving breast milk. Improved sterilization procedures and refrigeration in developing countries have reduced to some degree the gastrointestinal (GI) infections noted with formula feedings.</p>
                <p>Formulas are available for special-needs infants. Infants with phenylketonuria require formulas low in phenylalanine, and those unable to digest protein require nitrogen in the form of amino acid mixtures. Cow’s milk allergies sometimes respond to soybean-based formulas.</p>
                <p>Vegan diets supply all necessary nutrients if a variety of vegetables is selected. Some evidence suggests that high-fiber vegetarian diets lead to faster gastrointestinal transit time, resulting in reduced serum cholesterol levels, less diverticulitis, and a lower appendicitis incidence. Breast-feeding vegan mothers are given vitamin B12 to prevent the infant’s developing methylmalonic acidemia (an amino acid metabolism disorder involving a defect in the conversion of methylmalonyl-coenzyme A to succinyl-CoA); patients can present with failure to thrive, seizure, encephalopathy, stroke, or other neurologic manifestations. Toddlers on a vegan diet are given vitamin B12 and, because of the high fiber content and rapid gastrointestinal transit time, are given trace minerals that can be depleted.</p>

                </ol>
                <p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>E.</strong> Newborn infants have a relative vitamin K deficiency, especially if they are breast-fed; most infants are given vitamin K at birth to prevent deficiency-related bleeding complications.</li>
                    <li><strong>D.</strong> The patient appears to have failure to thrive, with deficiencies of vitamin K (bleeding problems), vitamin A (fontanelle fullness), and vitamin E (hemolytic anemia). Cystic fibrosis (associated with vitamin malabsorption) would explain the condition.</li>
                    <li><strong>C.</strong> The child in the question likely did not get iron (or vitamin D) supplementation in the first 6 months of life while exclusively breast-feeding and was switched to whole milk (low in iron) and to table foods (not supplemented with iron as are baby foods) at too young an age. All of the laboratory data are consistent with iron deficiency anemia; iron supplementation in this child with a resultant brisk erythrocyte response is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Failure of the child to respond to the iron therapy would require further evaluation.</li>
                    <li><strong>E.</strong> This patient appears to have galactosemia; uridyl transferase deficiency is the cause and the condition results in features of jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, vomiting, hypoglycemia, seizures, lethargy, irritability, poor feeding and failure to thrive, aminoaciduria, liver failure, mental retardation, and an increased risk of E coli sepsis. Children with galactosemia are managed with a lactose-free formula. The low-phenylalanine formulas are for infants with phenylketonuria; low-iron formulas serve no purpose other than causing iron deficiency anemia; the low-isoleucine, low-leucine, low-valine infant formulas are useful for patients with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD); and the amino acid–based formulas are excellent for children with malabsorption syndromes.</li>

                <h3>Clinical Pearls</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Breast-feeding is associated with lower morbidity and mortality (especially in developing countries) mostly because of a reduction in enteric pathogens and diarrhea associated with contaminated water used in formula preparation.</li>
                    <li>Breast-feeding provides all of the nutrients necessary for infant growth with the possible exceptions of vitamin D and fluoride, which usually are supplemented.</li>
                    <li>A breast-feeding vegan should supplement her infant’s diet with vitamin B12 to prevent methylmalonic acidemia and supplement her toddler’s diet with vitamin B12 and trace minerals.</li>

            <h2>Case 7: Rickets</h2>
            <div class="case-content">
                <h3>Case Description</h3>
                <p>An 8-month-old child has a 24-hour history of increased crying when she moves her right leg. She has a prominent bulge over the mid-right thigh where she had received an immunization yesterday. She has not had fever nor change in appetite, and she seems upset only when the leg is disturbed. The child underwent a failed Kasai procedure for biliary atresia and is awaiting a liver transplant. A radiograph of the leg demonstrates a mid-shaft fracture and poor mineralization.</p>
                <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the mechanism for this condition?</li>
                    <li>What are the best diagnostic tests to diagnose this condition?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Answers</h3>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> An 8-month-old child with a chronic medical condition, including biliary atresia, poor bone mineralization, and a fracture.</p>
                <p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Malabsorption of vitamin D (among other fat-soluble vitamins) due to lack of intestinal secretion of bile salts, resulting in rickets.</p>
                <p><strong>Best diagnostic tests:</strong> Serum 25(OH)D, calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase levels. Radiographs demonstrate poor bone mineralization.</p>

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Become familiar with the clinical presentation of rickets.</li>
                    <li>Understand the pathophysiology behind nutritional and nonnutritional rickets.</li>
                    <li>Appreciate some of the other metabolic causes of childhood fractures.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> This child has biliary atresia and underwent a failed Kasai procedure. Metabolic aberrations are expected while this child awaits liver transplantation. A review of her medications and compliance in receiving them is warranted. Because of the brittle nature of her bones, her leg was fractured while receiving immunizations.</p>

                <h3>Approach to The Child with Possible Rickets</h3>
                <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Biliary Atresia:</strong> A congenital condition affecting approximately 1 in 16,000 live births in which the liver’s bile ducts become blocked and fibrotic, resulting in reduced bile flow into the bowel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Genu Valgum:</strong> “Knock” knees.</li>
                    <li><strong>Genu Varum:</strong> “Bowed” legs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kasai Procedure:</strong> An operative procedure in which a bowel loop forms a duct to allow bile to drain from a liver with biliary atresia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rickets:</strong> Poor mineralization of growing bone or of osteoid tissue.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Clinical Approach:</strong> A patient with liver failure has poor bile salt secretion, resulting in poor fat-soluble vitamin absorption, including vitamin D. The poor vitamin D absorption causes low serum 25(OH)D, occasionally reduced serum calcium levels, markedly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, poor bone mineralization, and an increased risk of fractures. Children with liver failure and ascites are treated with loop diuretics, which often cause urinary calcium losses. Treatment, aimed at restoring normal bone mineralization, consists of high vitamin D doses and calcium supplementation.</p>
                <p>Nutritional rickets, resulting from inadequate dietary vitamin D or a lack of sunlight exposure, is rare in industrialized countries in healthy children. It is occasionally seen in dark-skinned infants who do not receive vitamin D supplementation or in breast-fed infants not exposed to sunlight. More common causes of rickets are liver or renal failure and a variety of biochemical abnormalities in calcium or phosphorus metabolism.</p>
                <p>The most common form of nonnutritional rickets is familial, primary hypophosphatemia (X-linked dominant) in which phosphate reabsorption is defective, and conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D in the proximal tubules of the kidneys is abnormal. Low serum 1,25(OH)2D, low–normal serum calcium, moderately low serum phosphate, and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels, hyperphosphaturia, and no evidence of hyperparathyroidism results. Children at the age of walking present with smooth lower-extremity bowing (as compared to angular bowing of calcium-deficient rickets), a waddling gait, genu varum, genu valgum, coxa vara, and short stature...</p>

                <p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>B.</strong> Lower-extremity bowing, low–normal calcium and phosphate levels, and normal parathyroid hormone levels suggest familial primary hypophosphatemia.</li>
                    <li><strong>A.</strong> A spiral fracture of the humerus is suspicious but not diagnostic for child abuse. While further laboratory testing is appropriate, the next step in the management of this child is to provide a safe environment until more data are available.</li>
                    <li><strong>E.</strong> In addition to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), often iron, and sometimes zinc is recommended.</li>
                    <li><strong>E.</strong> All of the rickets syndromes present with elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Schmid metaphyseal dysplasia, an autosomal dominant condition, presents in a similar way with short stature, leg bowing, and waddling gait. Radiographs show irregular long bone mineralization. Biochemically, Schmid-type metaphyseal dysostosis presents with normal serum calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase activity and normal urinary amino acid levels.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Clinical Pearls</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nutritional rickets (inadequate dietary vitamin D or sunlight exposure) is rare in healthy children in industrialized countries. Medical conditions (liver or renal failure) or abnormalities in calcium and phosphorus metabolism usually are responsible.</li>
                    <li>Primary hypophosphatemia (X-linked dominant) is the most common cause of nonnutritional rickets; proximal kidney tubule defects in phosphate reabsorption and conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D are seen. Findings include low–normal serum calcium, moderately low serum phosphate, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, and low serum 1,25(OH)2D levels, hyperphosphaturia, and no evidence of hyperparathyroidism.</li>

                <h3>Case Description</h3>
                <p>A family reports that their 5-year-old son has been increasingly confused over the last several hours. His emergency department vital signs show a heart rate of 180 beats/min, a blood pressure of 80/50 mm Hg, a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), and slow, deep respirations. His capillary refill is 5 seconds, and he has skin tenting as well as altered mental status. His mother reports that he has had a several pounds of weight loss over the last few weeks, has been increasingly tired for several days, and that she has been concerned about his 2- or 3-day history of thirst, frequent daytime urination, and new onset of nocturnal enuresis.</p>
                <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

                <h3>Answers</h3>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 5-year-old with weight loss, polydipsia, and polyuria who presents with dehydration and Kussmaul breathing.</p>
                <p><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).</p>
                <p><strong>Best therapy:</strong> Fluid rehydration, insulin, and close monitoring of serum glucose level and acidemia.</p>

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Understand the presentation of patients in DKA.</li>
                    <li>Appreciate the initial treatment strategies in the management of DKA.</li>
                    <li>Become familiar with pitfalls in the treatment of DKA.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> This patient is in extremis. He is tachycardic, hypotensive, hypothermic, and has delayed capillary refill with tenting of the skin. The ABCs of medicine apply. He is confused but not obtunded; he probably requires neither his airway controlled nor his breathing regulated. His examination suggests at least 10% dehydration; his circulatory status is marginal and requires rapid volume restoration. His history and physical examination suggest diabetes; a fingerstick glucose test confirms the diagnosis. The therapy for DKA rests on (1) aggressive volume repletion, (2) glucose control with insulin, and (3) correction of metabolic abnormalities.</p>

                <h3>Approach to Diabetic Ketoacidosis</h3>
                <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ketoacidosis:</strong> A condition resulting from deficient insulin availability, leading to lipid oxidation and metabolism rather than glucose metabolism. The insulin absence results in free fatty acid (FFA) released from adipose tissue and in unregulated hepatic FFA oxidation and ketogenesis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Type I Diabetes:</strong> Known by a variety of names, it is caused by a severe endogenous insulin deficiency and a requirement for exogenous insulin to prevent ketoacidosis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Type II Diabetes:</strong> Known by a variety of names, it usually consists of tissue-level insulin resistance (although exogenous insulin is often required) and rarely leads to ketoacidosis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kussmaul Breathing:</strong> Deep, rapid respirations associated with acidosis.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Clinical Approach:</strong> Patients with DKA represent a medical emergency. Such patients may require intubation, but usually this is seen later in the disease course. Children more commonly present with signs and symptoms of severe dehydration and acidosis. The history often is positive for polyuria, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal complaints. Hypothermia, hypotension, Kussmaul respirations, and acetone on the breath are common. As these signs and symptoms may be nonspecific, especially in younger children, a high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis.</p>
                <p>Laboratory data demonstrate an elevated glucose level (often 400-800 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (with anion gap, ie, excess endogenous anion production such as from lactic acid), and hyperketonemia. Serum electrolyte levels usually show hyponatremia and normal or slightly elevated potassium (despite intracellular potassium depletion). Elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are commonly seen, reflecting the dehydration. White blood cell counts (WCBs) often are elevated, especially if a bacterial infection is exacerbating the condition.</p>
                <p>Treating DKA includes initial vascular volume expansion (often with normal saline) and then correction of the hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia. Intravenous (IV) fluid boluses sufficient to stabilize the heart rate and blood pressure are sometimes required, and then a slower IV rate (usually a saline solution with or without some glucose) to replace fluid losses and to ensure adequate urine flow is initiated. Potassium is added to IV fluids after urine output is established to counteract the patient’s total body potassium depletion...</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>A.</strong> The patient likely has poor diabetes control. The hemoglobin A1C, commonly used to follow glucose control, measures the average glucose levels over the previous 2 or 3 months. The hemoglobin A1C goal for most diabetics is 6% to 9%. Levels greater than 12% suggest poor control, and levels 9% to 12% represent fair control. In the Somogyi phenomenon, a patient has nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes manifested as night terrors, headaches, or early morning sweating and then presents a few hours later with hyperglycemia, ketonuria, and glucosuria. Counter-regulatory hormones, in response to the hypoglycemia, cause the hyperglycemia.</li>
                    <li><strong>E.</strong> Up to 75% of newly diagnosed diabetics have a progressive decrease in the daily insulin requirement in the months after their diabetes diagnosis; a few patients temporarily require no insulin. This “honeymoon” period usually lasts a few months, and then an insulin requirement returns. Patients are told that the “honeymoon” period is not a cure and that they should expect a return to insulin requirement.</li>
                    <li><strong>D.</strong> The patient likely has PID; glucosuria is a stress response to the infection and does not represent glucose metabolism problems. All of the options in the question can cause abdominal pain. Although diabetes mellitus is in the differential, DKA more likely presents with ketoacidosis (significantly decreased serum bicarbonate levels) and high serum glucose levels.</li>
                    <li><strong>D.</strong> The description is of an obese adolescent female with candida vaginitis (the vaginal discharge) and acanthosis nigricans (the nuchal dark rash) consistent with type II diabetes. This condition is far more common in overweight children, especially those with a family history of the condition.</li>

            <h2>Case 9: Routine Well-Child Care</h2>
            <div class="case-content">
                <h3>Case Description</h3>
                <p>A 2-month-old child you have followed since birth arrives for his routine “baby shots.” His mother’s pregnancy was uncomplicated, and he has been healthy without significant problems.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the next step in the care of this patient?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Answer</h3>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A healthy 2-month-old infant due for a routine well-child visit.</p>
                <p><strong>Next step:</strong> Gather interval history (feeding, sleep), obtain appropriate measurements (length, weight, and head circumference), review sensory and developmental or behavioral screenings (ensure that he can see and hear, and that he is developing normally), perform a physical examination, perform general and specialized procedures (ensure that his neonatal state screen is normal and provide immunizations), and offer anticipatory guidance.</p>

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Become familiar with the goals of the routine well-child (or health supervision) session.</li>
                    <li>Become familiar with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Recommended Childhood and Adolescent Immunization Schedule.</li>
                    <li>Learn the side effects and contraindications of common childhood immunizations.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Well-child care for this healthy infant is uncomplicated. For children with special needs, such as Down syndrome or sickle cell disease, guidelines outline their specific considerations. For children with multiple handicaps, such as those resulting from extreme prematurity, no specific guidelines exist; the providers adapt national “well-child care” guidelines as appropriate.</p>

                <h3>Approach to Childhood Well-Child Care</h3>
                <p><strong>Clinical Approach:</strong> Goals of a health supervision visit include evaluating a child’s physical, developmental, psychosocial, and educational status to identify problems early; prompt intervention then can be instituted. Anticipatory guidance aims to foster good health habits, prevent illness, and assist in family communication.</p>
                <p>Most pediatric providers follow commonly available preventive health-care guidelines. The AAP periodically updates its Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care, which outlines questions, medical procedures, and counseling areas for children’s birth through 21 years. Other sources include guidelines from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and “Bright Futures” (National Center for Education in Maternal and Child Healthcare). Regardless of the source, guidelines are modified to fit local practice and to best serve the patients’ needs.</p>
                <p><strong>Immunizations:</strong> Immunizations are part of the well-child visit. They are cost-effective and efficacious in improving children’s general health and well-being. Vaccination programs have eliminated smallpox and reduced the incidence of other diseases (Haemophilus influenzae type b [Hib], polio, measles, tetanus, rubella, and diphtheria) such that medical students and residents are unlikely to see a single case.</p>
                <p>The Recommended Childhood and Adolescent Immunization Schedule, updated annually and available on the Internet, is supported by a variety of organizations, including the AAP, the American Academy of Family Practice, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
                <p>Pediatric immunizations are extraordinarily safe. The side effects risk is extremely low, especially when compared to the benefit of preventing morbidity and mortality from communicable diseases. However, vaccine safety sometimes is scrutinized by the news media and by parents. The health-care provider must have access to scientifically sound and updated side effect data to allay these fears.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>C.</strong> The Hib vaccine generally is not recommended for children 5 years of age or older.</li>
                    <li><strong>E.</strong> Juices (undiluted) are avoided until approximately 6 months of age (in a cup and not in the bottle). At 1 month of age an infant should be able to fix and follow, but not be expected to sleep through the night by age 2 to 3 months. Realistic targets for development include rolling over at 4 months and sitting by 6 months. Potty training starts when the child shows interest, usually no earlier than age 2 years. Parents are told to place healthy children on their backs (or side) for sleep to reduce the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome.</li>
                    <li><strong>D.</strong> Children fix and follow on the human face from birth. A 5-month-old child who does not engage in eye contact is abnormal.</li>
                    <li><strong>C.</strong> Tuberculosis and lead testing are performed on at-risk children. Pelvic examinations are performed when girls become sexually active or by age 18 to 21 years. Screening hematocrits are done at age 9 to 12 months, and cholesterol tests are done for children with familial risk factors.</li>

                <h3>Clinical Pearls</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>True contraindications for vaccinations are rare but include immediate hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine, the vaccine component, or the preservative in the agent.</li>
                    <li>Conditions that are not contraindications for vaccinations include mild upper respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and low-grade fever.</li>
                    <li>In general, pregnant and severely immunocompromised patients should not receive live virus vaccinations, but the vaccines are given to children living in the home with a pregnant woman. Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccinations can be given to asymptomatic patients with HIV.</li>

                <p><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Pneumonia.</p>
                <p><strong>Next step in evaluation:</strong> A chest x-ray (CXR) often is indicated to ascertain if radiographic changes support clinical findings. In addition to chest radiography, pulse oximetry and selected laboratory tests (complete blood count [CBC], blood culture, and nasal wash for selected viral antigens) may help elucidate the etiology and extent of infection, as well as direct possible antimicrobial therapy.</p>

                <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Describe the etiologies of pneumonia and their age predilections.</li>
                    <li>Describe various clinical and radiographic findings in pneumonia.</li>

                </ol>
                <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> The most important initial goal in managing this patient is to ensure adequacy of the ABCs (maintaining the Airway, controlling the Breathing, and ensuring adequate Circulation). A patient with pneumonia may present with varying degrees of respiratory compromise. Oxygen may be required, and in severe cases respiratory failure may be imminent, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient with pneumonia and sepsis also may have evidence of circulatory failure (septic shock) and require vigorous fluid resuscitation. After the basics of resuscitation have been achieved, further evaluation and management can be initiated.</p>

                <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rales:</strong> Wet or “crackly” inspiratory breath sounds due to alveolar fluid or debris; usually heard in pneumonia or congestive heart failure (CHF).</li>
                    <li><strong>Pleural Rub:</strong> Inspiratory and expiratory “rubbing” or scratching breath sounds heard when inflamed visceral and parietal pleurae come together.</li>
                    <li><strong>Staccato Cough:</strong> Coughing spells with quiet intervals, often heard in croup and chlamydial pneumonia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pleural Effusion:</strong> Fluid accumulation in the pleural space; may be associated with chest pain or dyspnea; can be transudate or exudate depending on results of fluid analysis for protein and lactate dehydrogenase; origins include cardiovascular (congestive heart failure), infectious (mycobacterial pneumonia), and malignant (lymphoma).</li>
                    <li><strong>Empyema:</strong> Purulent infection in the pleural space; may be associated with chest pain, dyspnea, or fever; usually seen in conjunction with bacterial pneumonia or pulmonary abscess.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pulse Oximetry:</strong> Noninvasive estimation of arterial oxyhemoglobin concentration (SaO2) using select wavelengths of light.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Clinical Approach:</strong> Pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a diagnosis made clinically and radiographically. The typical pediatric patient with pneumonia may have traditional findings (fever, cough, tachypnea, and toxicity) or very few signs, depending on the organism involved and the patient’s age and health status.</p>
                <p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> LRTI typically begins with organism acquisition via inhalation of infected droplets or contact with a contaminated surface. Depending on the organism, spread to distal airways occurs over varying intervals. Bacterial infection typically progresses rapidly over a few days; viral pneumonia may develop more gradually...</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>A.</strong> Cough and increased respiratory effort in an afebrile infant with eye discharge are consistent with Chlamydia. Transmission typically occurs during vaginal delivery. Approximately 25% of infants born to mothers with Chlamydia develop conjunctivitis; about half of these develop pneumonia. Most infants present with respiratory infection in the second month of life, but symptoms can be seen as early as the second week. Inner eyelid swabs are sent for PCR, and oral erythromycin or sulfisoxazole (latter only in infants older than 2 months of age) is given for 2 weeks for either conjunctivitis or pneumonia.</li>
                    <li><strong>C.</strong> Tachypnea and lethargy are prominent in this patient with clinical pneumonia. Pulse oximetry should urgently be performed to ascertain whether oxygen is required. Sputum culturing is reasonable, but an adequate and diagnostically useful specimen can only be obtained from a 2-year-old by endotracheal aspirate or bronchoscopy. In this otherwise healthy toddler for whom concerns for atypical pneumonia are high, invasive maneuvers are not indicated. Viruses (RSV and adenovirus) are prominent at this age; one might consider performing a nasal swab for viral antigens. Abdominal pain, as noted in this question, can be seen as a presenting symptom in pneumonia, probably as a result of irritation of the diaphragm by pulmonary infection.</li>
                    <li><strong>C.</strong> The scenario is typical for pediatric tuberculosis. Neck and perihilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary or extrapulmonary manifestations can occur, with miliary disease and meningitis more common in infants and younger children. Fever, weight loss, and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms (possible left pleural effusion in this patient) are archetypal tuberculosis (TB) findings. A PPD should be placed, and consideration given to hospitalizing this patient in negative pressure isolation for further evaluation beyond PPD placement (pleurocentesis, bronchoalveolar lavage, gastric aspirates) and possible antituberculous treatment.</li>
                    <li><strong>B.</strong> All of these findings are consistent with mycoplasmal infection (“walking pneumonia”). The incubation period for mycoplasma is 5 to 7 days, and most symptoms are noted during the second to third week of infection. Hemolysis occurs as antibodies attach to red blood cells, prompting reticulocyte production. If necessary, nasopharyngeal aspirate for PCR or measurement of cold agglutinins may help aid in the diagnosis. Auscultatory and radiographic findings vary in this infection; a normal CXR or one with an interstitial pattern, effusion, or atelectasis could be seen.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Clinical Pearls</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The etiology of pneumonia varies according to the patient’s age. Neonates have the greatest risk of group B Streptococcus, toddlers are more likely to have respiratory syncytial virus, and adolescents usually contract mycoplasma.</li>
                    <li>Efforts in tuberculosis management should be directed toward isolating an organism and obtaining sensitivities, thus allowing selection of the optimal antituberculous regimen.</li>

    <h2>Case 11: Organophosphate Poisoning</h2>
    <p>You are moonlighting in a rural emergency room when a father rushes his 3-year-old daughter into the waiting area. You quickly determine that he and the child have been at a relative’s farm where they were spraying for bugs in an old barn. The child had been fine, but while at the farm developed abdominal cramping, cough, drooling, and tearing. While in route the child seems to be having increased respiratory difficulty, and the dad notes she soiled and urinated upon herself.</p>
    <h3>Key Questions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the most likely diagnosis?</li>
      <li>How is the diagnosis made?</li>
      <li>What is the best therapy?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Answers to Case 11: Organophosphate Poisoning</h3>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 3-year-old, previously healthy child who, while helping her father spray for bugs, develops salivation, lacrimation, respiratory distress, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Organophosphate poisoning.</li>
      <li><strong>Making the diagnosis:</strong> High index of suspicion so therapy is not delayed; confirmation via decreased serum pseudocholinesterase and erythrocyte cholinesterase levels.</li>
      <li><strong>Best therapy:</strong> Decontamination of the child, supportive care, administration of atropine or pralidoxime.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Understand the signs, symptoms, and treatment of organophosphate poisoning.</li>
      <li>Be familiar with the treatment options of various commonly ingested agents.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Considerations</h4>
    <p>This child is demonstrating evidence of organophosphate poisoning, the leading cause of nonpharmaceutical ingestion fatality in children. She was exposed during the spraying for insects in the barn, and is at risk for ongoing absorption of toxin until decontamination of her clothing is achieved. Note: For some children exposed to a toxic substance, parents are able to provide a container of the toxic agent. For others either the container is not available or the symptoms are not obviously related to a toxic exposure. In all cases a thorough history and physical examination, along with a high index of suspicion in younger children, is required to ensure the diagnosis of accidental toxic exposure is made.</p>
    <h3>Approach to Organophosphate Poisoning</h3>
    <h4>Definitions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nicotinic Symptoms:</strong> Cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmia); muscle (fasciculations, weakness, tremors); respiratory failure due to diaphragm paralysis; hypertension.</li>
      <li><strong>Muscarinic Symptoms:</strong> Gastrointestinal (emesis, urinary and fecal incontinence); respiratory (bronchorrhea, bronchospasm); cardiac (hypotension, bradycardia); tearing and drooling; miosis.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
    <p>Millions of children are poisoned each year with about 90% of exposures occurring in the home. About half of all accidental poisonings occur in children younger than 5 years of age. Children aged from about 6 to 12 years are much less likely to be exposed, and those with toxic exposures beyond 12 years of age often do so intentionally. Death due to accidental poisonings has become unusual since a variety of measures have been implemented, including poison prevention as part of all well-child visits, development of regional poison control centers, child-resistant packaging, and improved medical management.</p>
    <p>Organophosphate poisoning can occur across skin or mucous membranes, by inhalation, or by ingestion. Commonly found in such pesticides as parathion, malathion, and diazinon, organophosphates bind irreversibly to cholinesterase of neurons and erythrocytes, as well as to liver pseudocholinesterase. The common finding is failure to terminate the effects of acetylcholine at the receptor sites.</p>
    <p>Signs and symptoms of cholinergic excess are often remembered with the mnemonic “dumb bells” which includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>D: Diarrhea/defecation</li>
      <li>U: Urination</li>
      <li>M: Miosis</li>
      <li>B: Bradycardia</li>
      <li>B: Bronchorrhea</li>
      <li>E: Emesis/excitation of muscles</li>
      <li>L: Lacrimation</li>
      <li>S: Salivation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to these muscarinic and nicotinic effects, central effects including obtundation, seizures, and apnea are seen.</p>
    <p>Confirmation of the exposure can be confirmed by finding decreased serum pseudocholinesterase and erythrocyte cholinesterase levels, but the correlation to these levels to the magnitude of exposure or the symptoms observed is poor. Thus, a high index of suspicion must be maintained to quickly and accurately diagnose organophosphate exposure.</p>
    <p>Treatment of the patient exposed to organophosphate consists of rapid decontamination by removing all clothing and washing of all skin surfaces. For ingestions, gastric lavage or activated charcoal may be attempted, but the compounds are rapidly absorbed and the benefits somewhat limited. The ABCs of medicine apply: preserve the Airway (intubation may be required); maintain Breathing (excessive secretions may require frequent suctioning); and ensure appropriate Circulation.</p>
    <p>Two specific therapies to counter the effects of organophosphate poisonings include atropine and pralidoxime. Atropine works by antagonizing the muscarinic receptor; large, repeated, and sometimes continuous doses may be required. Often the amount and number of atropine doses required correlates to the degree of exposure and may assist in the prediction of course duration. Pralidoxime is a cholinesterase-reactivating oxime, often used for patients with significant muscle weakness, especially if mechanical ventilation is required owing to muscle failure.</p>
    <p>Careful attention to a child’s environment can help prevent countless instances of toxic ingestion. Counseling parents to “poison proof” their home is a first step toward prevention. Written and video materials are readily available through the American Academy of Pediatrics, local and state health departments, and poison control centers. All families are taught to become familiar with the national network of poison control centers, reached toll-free at 1-800-222-1222.</p>

      <li><strong>B.</strong> Between 1947 and 1973 asbestos was commonly sprayed on school ceilings as a fire retardant. Deterioration results in release of microscopic fibers into the air. Drop ceilings or placement of barriers usually is sufficient protection against this carcinogen.</li>
      <li><strong>D.</strong> The child in the question is unlikely to develop symptoms (the quantity of mercury is small); a larger acute elemental ingestion might result in a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) complaints. If the elemental mercury were in vapor form, GI complaints would be seen, along with fever, chills, headaches, visual changes, cough, chest pain, and possibly pneumonitis and pulmonary edema. Exposure to inorganic mercury salts (pesticides, disinfectants, explosives, dry batteries) can cause gastroesophageal burns, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hematemesis, hematochezia, cardiovascular collapse, or death. Ataxia, dysarthria, and paresthesias are seen in methyl mercury intoxication (contaminated fish exposure). Gingivostomatitis, tremor, and neuropsychiatric disturbances are seen with chronic inorganic mercury intoxication; indeed, the term “mad as a hatter” originates from the occupational hazard of workers’ exposure in the early industrial period to mercury-containing vapors during the process of felt hat making.</li>
      <li><strong>C.</strong> Acute arsenic ingestions can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The third spacing and hemorrhage in the gut can lead to hypovolemic shock. Cardiac symptoms include ventricular tachycardia (QT prolongation) and congestive heart failure (CHF). These patients can develop seizures, cerebral edema, encephalopathy, and coma. Early on, patients develop loss of deep tendon reflexes, paralysis, painful dysesthesias, and respiratory failure similar to Guillain-Barré syndrome. Fever, anemia, alopecia, hepatitis, and renal failure also can be seen.</li>
      <li><strong>B.</strong> Fat-soluble compounds can be transmitted transplacentally (but benzene would be unusual). Parents’ work clothes can transmit potentially hazardous compounds. Arts and crafts supplies likely do not contain asbestos. Vehicular emissions are responsible for a number of pollutants, many of which are carcinogens, but iron intoxication would be unusual. Pencil “lead” is actually graphite (carbon) and not elemental lead.</li>

    <h2>Case 12: Sexual Abuse</h2>
    <p>A mother brings her 8-year-old daughter to your office because she has noticed a “yellowish” stain on her daughter’s panties. The mother reports the girl recently started using many sexually explicit words, her grades have dropped significantly, and she has become quiet and reluctant to interact. When interviewed alone, the child begins crying and states that her mother’s boyfriend touches her “private with his private part.” The child’s physical examination is normal, except for a yellowish vaginal discharge and erythema of the perihymenal tissue. A wet mount microscopic examination is negative for trichomonads, bacterial vaginosis, and yeast. A nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) from the vagina is negative for Chlamydia trachomatis but is positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.</p>

      <li><strong>Best management:</strong> Confirm the test result by performing a second test (either a true culture for N gonorrhoeae or a second NAAT that targets a different portion of the organism’s genome) and then administer treatment in the form of a single dose of ceftriaxone 125 mg intramuscularly.</li>
      <li><strong>Next step:</strong> A blood test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) for syphilis should be obtained. Children’s Protective Services and/or law enforcement must be notified.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Know how to approach the medical evaluation of a child who complains that she has been sexually abused.</li>
      <li>Know that most children who are sexually abused have no physical findings of abuse.</li>
      <li>Be familiar with the different diagnostic testing methods for chlamydia and gonorrhea.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Considerations</h4>
    <p>Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are highly sensitive and specific tests commonly used to detect infections caused by C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae. The gravity of these diagnoses in children dictates confirmation of a positive test with either a true culture or a second NAAT that targets a different portion of the organism’s genome. Consultation with a child abuse pediatrician or pediatric infectious disease specialist is also recommended in these cases. Transmission of N gonorrhoeae occurs only via sexual contact. Therefore, a confirmed diagnosis indicates that this child was sexually abused. An attempt to identify when the last sexual contact is thought to have occurred is important because periodic testing for HIV and syphilis is indicated for at least 6 months. It is important to determine if this child’s home environment is safe. Children’s Protective Services and law enforcement officials generally work in tandem to ensure the safety of the child and to perform criminal investigations of child sexual abuse. Child abuse specialists can help coordinate this child’s care and provide assistance in medical management.</p>
    <h3>Approach to Sexual Abuse in the Child</h3>
    <h4>Definitions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sexual Abuse:</strong> Sexual activity in which a child engages but which the child cannot comprehend, cannot give consent to, or is not developmentally prepared for; or sexual activity that is a violation of the law or societal taboos. Coercion, power imbalance, or a significant age gap may be present.</li>
      <li><strong>Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT):</strong> A nonculture method that may be used on swab or urine specimens to test for C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
    <p>It is estimated that by age 18 years, one in four women and one in six men in the United States are victims of sexual abuse. Abuse can be noncontact (exhibitionism, voyeurism, pornography) or contact (fondling, anogenital contact). Most victims of sexual abuse know their abusers; they may be family members, friends, or acquaintances.</p>
    <p>Supportive and sensitive history taking, detailed documentation of the child’s disclosure, and careful examination are imperative. More than three quarters of sexually abused children have no sign of physical trauma on examination (in part because anogenital area tissues heal rapidly and often without scarring), and even fewer have a sexually transmitted disease (STD). When injury does occur, it may be nonspecific (erythema); occasionally there are signs of penetrating trauma, such as a tear of the posterior hymen (ie, between the 3 and 9 o’clock positions) or a deep tear into the anal muscle. If the suspected abuse occurred near the time of medical evaluation (eg, within approximately 72 hours), forensic evidence may be available from the child’s body or the clothing worn at the time of the assault. An “evidence collection kit” is used for such specimen collection; contents are kept in police laboratories and are analyzed if legal proceedings require.</p>
    <p>Pediatric sexual assault victims are tested for sexually transmissible diseases (chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomonas, HIV, and syphilis) whenever anal-genital, genital-genital, or oral-genital contact has occurred. Historically, true cultures for chlamydia and gonorrhea have been preferred in prepubertal children and nonsexually active teens because of their high specificities. However, it may be desirable to perform a more sensitive NAAT. Because of its potential implications, a positive NAAT result for a prepubertal child or nonsexually active teen must be confirmed with either a culture or a second NAAT that amplifies a different gene sequence. In the acute setting, prophylactic STD and pregnancy medications may be indicated. All sexual abuse victims require psychological support. Social workers can be helpful in identifying and mitigating stressors in the child’s environment.</p>

    </ol>
    <h3>Answers</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>C.</strong> Many girls abused over time neither report the abuse nor show physical evidence of penetrating vaginal trauma. Physical complaints that sometimes are associated with sexual abuse include dysuria, enuresis, frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs), genital irritation and itching, vaginal or penile discharge, vaginal bleeding, genital or anal pain, abdominal pain, and encopresis. Nonspecific behavioral findings may include nightmares, sleep disorders, developmentally inappropriate sexual behaviors, regressive behaviors, eating disorders, acting out aggressively, poor school performance, and poor peer relationships. The list of alternative diagnoses includes dermatologic conditions, nonsexual trauma, constipation, vaginal foreign bodies, psychosocial stressors, and psychiatric illness. In most cases, the perpetrator of sexual abuse is known to the victim. Developmentally delayed children are at higher risk. Except in cases of vertical transmission, Chlamydia and gonorrhea are diagnostic of sexual contact.</li>
      <li><strong>B.</strong> Anal condylomata in children younger than age 3 years are often acquired at birth through direct contact with genital condylomata in the birth canal. A full history is important to determine the risk of abuse versus the risk of acquiring the infection at birth.</li>
      <li><strong>D.</strong> Pinworms cause intense itching, loss of appetite, and episodic abdominal pain; humans are the only natural host (see also Case 38). Viewing under a microscope adhesive tape placed over the anus can identify the worm’s eggs (and, less likely, a tiny, threadlike worm). Treatment usually consists of a single dose of mebendazole, which is repeated in 2 weeks. Family members who sleep in the child’s bed also are treated. Bed clothes are washed at the time of treatment because ova can remain viable for 2 to 3 weeks in moist environments. Eczema could involve more than just the perianal region.</li>
      <li><strong>E.</strong> Repeated penetrating anal trauma causes loss of stellate pattern of the anus, loss of tone, and deep fissures. Constipation would be less likely to cause such dramatic findings. Sexual abuse must be suspected, and further history is indicated.</li>

    <h3>Answers to Case 13: Acute Otitis Media</h3>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A toddler presents with ear pain and fever.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Acute otitis media (AOM).</li>
      <li><strong>Best therapy:</strong> Oral antibiotics.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Be familiar with the epidemiology of otitis media (OM) in children.</li>
      <li>Understand the treatment option for this condition.</li>
      <li>Learn the consequences of severe infection.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Considerations</h4>
    <p>Otitis media is high on the differential diagnosis for this child with upper respiratory infection (URI) and ear pain. The diagnosis can be confirmed by pneumatic otoscopy and treatment started. A “telephone diagnosis” should be avoided.</p>
    <h3>Approach to Acute Otitis Media</h3>
    <h4>Definitions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Acute Otitis Media (AOM):</strong> A condition of otalgia (ear pain), fever, and other symptoms along with findings of a red, opaque, poorly moving, bulging tympanic membrane (TM).</li>
      <li><strong>Myringotomy and Placement of Pressure Equalization Tubes:</strong> A surgical procedure involving TM incision and placement of pressure equalization (PE) tubes (tiny plastic or metal tubes anchored into the TM) to ventilate the middle ear and help prevent reaccumulation of middle ear fluid.</li>
      <li><strong>Otitis Media with Effusion:</strong> A condition in which fluid collects behind the TM but without signs and symptoms of AOM. Sometimes called serous OM.</li>
      <li><strong>Pneumatic Otoscopy:</strong> The process of obtaining a tight ear canal seal with a speculum and then applying slight positive and negative pressure with a rubber bulb to verify TM mobility.</li>
      <li><strong>Tympanocentesis:</strong> A minor surgical procedure in which a small incision is made into the TM to drain pus and fluid from the middle ear space. This procedure is rarely done in the primary care office, but rather is done by the specialist.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
    <p>Otitis media is a common childhood diagnosis. Common bacterial pathogens include Streptococcus pneumoniae, 
	nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. 
	Other organisms, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, 
	and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are seen in neonates and patients with immune deficiencies. 
	Viruses can cause AOM, and in many cases the etiology is unknown. 
	Acute OM is diagnosed in a child with fever (usually <104°F [40°C]), ear pain (often nocturnal awakening child from sleep), and generalized malaise. Systemic symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache. Examination findings include a red, bulging TM that does not move well with pneumatic otoscopy. The TM may be opaque with pus behind it, the middle ear landmarks may be obscured, and, if the TM has ruptured, pus may be seen in the ear canal.
	</p>
    <p>Depending on a community’s bacterial resistance patterns, amoxicillin at doses up to 80 to 90 mg/kg/d for 7 to 10 days is often the initial treatment. If clinical failure is noted after 3 treatment days, a change to amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime axetil, azithromycin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, or tympanocentesis is considered. Adjuvant therapies (analgesics or antipyretics) are often indicated, but other measures (antihistamines, decongestants, and corticosteroids) are ineffective.</p>
    <p>After an AOM episode, middle ear fluid can persist for up to several months. If hearing is normal, middle ear effusion often is treated with observation; some practitioners treat with antibiotics. When the fluid does not resolve or recurrent episodes of suppurative OM occur, especially if hearing loss is noted, myringotomy with PE tubes is often used.</p>
    <p>Rare but serious OM complications include mastoiditis, temporal bone osteomyelitis, facial nerve paralysis, epidural and subdural abscess formation, meningitis, lateral sinus thrombosis, and otitic hydrocephalus (evidence of increased intracranial pressure with OM). An AOM patient whose clinical course is unusual or prolonged is evaluated for one of these conditions.</p>

    <h3>Answers</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>A.</strong> The patient likely has an otitis externa that was caused by his swimming (also known as swimmer’s ear). Treatment is the application of a topical agent as described. Insertion of a wick may assist in excess fluid absorption in the macerated ear canal. Causative organisms include Pseudomonas species (or other gram-negative organisms), S aureus, and occasionally fungus (Candida or Aspergillus species).</li>
      <li><strong>B.</strong> The child has mastoiditis, a clinical diagnosis that can require CT scan confirmation. Treatment includes myringotomy, fluid culture, and parenteral antibiotics. Surgical drainage of the mastoid air cells may be needed if improvement is not seen in 24 to 48 hours.</li>
      <li><strong>E.</strong> After failing several antibiotic regimens, tympanocentesis and culture of the middle ear fluid are indicated.</li>
      <li><strong>A.</strong> Very young children with OM (especially if irritable or lethargic) are at higher risk for bacteremia or other serious infection. Hospitalization and parenteral antibiotics often are needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Case 14: Neonatal Resuscitation</h2>
    <p>You are called stat to the delivery room because a now 2-minute-old infant was born floppy and blue and has not responded well to stimulation and blow-by oxygen. The obstetrician who is resuscitating the infant informs you that the child was born by a spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 24-year-old gravida 1 woman. Her pregnancy was uncomplicated. Fetal heart tones were stable throughout the labor. Spinal anesthesia was partially effective and was supplemented with intravenous (IV) meperidine (Demerol) and promethazine (Phenergan). The amniotic fluid was not bile-stained, and the mother had no evidence of intraamniotic infection.</p>
    <h3>Key Question</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the next step?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Answer to Case 14: Neonatal Resuscitation</h3>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A newborn is born floppy, blue, and has responded poorly to initial resuscitation efforts.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Next step:</strong> Evaluate for heart rate (HR) and respirations. If no respirations are found or if HR is less than 100 bpm (beats/min), initiate positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) by bag and mask. Because this mother received meperidine during the labor process, naloxone (Narcan) administration is an important step in resuscitation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Understand the steps of newborn delivery room resuscitation.</li>
      <li>Become familiar with use of the Apgar score.</li>
      <li>Become familiar with conditions causing newborn transition problems.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Considerations</h4>
    <p>This depressed infant was born to a healthy mother without prenatal or delivery complications other than failed epidural anesthesia. PPV was initiated and naloxone administered. The provider must appreciate the timing of maternal meperidine administration and its continued neonatal effects.</p>
    <h3>Approach to Neonatal Resuscitation</h3>
    <h4>Definitions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Narcosis:</strong> The condition of deep stupor or unconsciousness produced by a chemical substance such as a drug or anesthesia.</li>
      <li><strong>Perinatal Hypoxia:</strong> Inadequate oxygenation of a neonate that, if severe, can lead to brainstem depression and secondary apnea unresponsive to stimulation.</li>
      <li><strong>Positive-Pressure Ventilation (PPV):</strong> Mechanically breathing using a bag and mask.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
    <p>Delivery room resuscitation follows the ABC rules of resuscitation for patients of all ages: establish and maintain the airway, control the breathing, and maintain the circulation with medications and chest compressions (if necessary). In this case, the meperidine given during labor probably is responsible for the infant’s apnea and poor respiratory effort. Neonates with narcosis usually have a good HR response but poor respiratory effort in response to bag-and-mask ventilation. The therapy for narcotic-related depression is intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SQ), or endotracheal administration of naloxone (Narcan); repeated doses may be required should respiratory depression recur.</p>
    <p>The Apgar score is widely used to evaluate a neonate’s transition from the intra- to extrauterine environment. Scores of 0, 1, or 2 are given at 1 and 5 minutes of life for the listed signs. The 1-minute score helps to determine an infant’s well-being, and scores less than 3 historically have been used to indicate the need for immediate resuscitation. In current practice HR, color, and respiratory rate (RR) rather than the 1-minute Apgar score are used to determine this need. The 5-minute score is one indicator of how successful the resuscitation efforts were. Some continue to measure Apgar scores beyond the 5-minute period to determine the continued effects of resuscitation efforts. The Apgar score alone cannot determine neonatal morbidity or mortality.</p>

When crying she is pink; when not she makes vigorous respiratory efforts but becomes dusky. Which of the following is the likely explanation for her symptoms?
        <ol type="A">
          <li>Choanal atresia</li>
          <li>Diaphragmatic hernia</li>
          <li>Meconium aspiration</li>
          <li>Neonatal narcosis</li>
          <li>Pneumothorax</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Answers</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>E.</strong> An attempt is made to remove the meconium from the oropharynx and the airway prior to initiation of respirations. Ideally, the obstetrician will begin suctioning the meconium upon delivery of the head, and the pediatrician will further remove meconium with an aspirator or through endotracheal intubation with suction. Ventilation is initiated after meconium is removed. The goal is to remove airway meconium and to prevent its aspiration into the small airways where ventilation-perfusion mismatch may occur with deleterious effects.</li>
      <li><strong>E.</strong> The case describes diaphragmatic hernia. As a result of herniated bowel contents into the chest, these children often have pulmonary hypoplasia. Bag-and-mask ventilation will cause accumulation of bowel gas (which is located in the chest) and further respiratory compromise. Therefore, endotracheal intubation is the best course of action.</li>
      <li><strong>E.</strong> If the HR is still less than 60 bpm despite PPV with 100% oxygen, then chest compressions are given for 30 seconds. If the HR is still less than 60 bpm, then drug therapy (usually epinephrine) is indicated.</li>
      <li><strong>A.</strong> Infants are obligate nose breathers. When crying they can breathe through their mouth, but they must have a patent nose when quiet. Choanal atresia is identified by passing a feeding tube through each nostril or by identification of mist on cold metal held under the infant’s nose. Should choanal atresia be diagnosed, endotracheal intubation bypasses the airway obstruction until surgical repair can be completed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Clinical Pearls</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>An infant with slow heart rate, poor color, and inadequate respiratory effort requires immediate resuscitation.</li>
      <li>The therapy for narcosis (newborn respiratory depression due to maternal pain control) is intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, or endotracheal administration of naloxone (Narcan).</li>
      <li>A child with diaphragmatic hernia often presents with immediate respiratory distress, scaphoid abdomen, cyanosis, and heart sounds displaced to the right side of the chest.</li>
      <li>Choanal atresia results in respiratory distress when a child stops crying; immediate treatment is intubation until surgical correction can be completed.</li>

    <h2>Case 15: Cerebral Palsy</h2>
    <p>A 12-month-old boy whom you have followed since birth arrives for a well-child visit. The mother is concerned that the baby’s manner of crawling, where he drags his legs rather than using a four-limbed movement, is abnormal. She says that the child only recently began crawling and he does not pull to a stand. You noted at his 6-month visit that he was not yet rolling over nor sitting; previous visits were unremarkable as was the mother’s pregnancy and vaginal delivery. On examination today, you note that he positions his legs in a “scissoring” posture when held by the axillae.</p>
    <h3>Key Questions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the initial step in the evaluation of this child?</li>
      <li>What is the most likely diagnosis?</li>
      <li>What is the next step in the evaluation?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Answers to Case 15: Cerebral Palsy</h3>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 12-month-old boy crawls using primarily his upper extremities, and holds his legs in a “scissoring” posture when suspended.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Initial step:</strong> Gather detailed history, focusing on developmental questions; obtain a thorough pregnancy, birth, social, and family histories; and perform a detailed neurologic examination.</li>
      <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Cerebral palsy (CP).</li>
      <li><strong>Next step:</strong> Vision and hearing testing, consider a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and arrange for therapy with a developmental specialist.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Know the definition of CP.</li>
      <li>Recognize the classifications of CP.</li>
      <li>Know the basic therapeutic approach to CP.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Considerations</h4>
    <p>The spasticity of the baby’s lower extremities described is abnormal and is suggestive of CP. He has gross motor delay. A complete developmental and neurologic assessment is crucial for initiating therapies that will help him achieve maximal functional outcome. Although often of low yield, an attempt should be made to identify the etiology of the child’s CP. Knowing the etiology can aid in developing a treatment plan, in family planning (especially if the etiology is inherited), and in assuaging parental guilt for this child’s condition.</p>
    <h3>Approach to Cerebral Palsy</h3>
    <h4>Definitions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cerebral Palsy (CP):</strong> A disorder of movement and posture that results from an insult to or anomaly of the immature central nervous system (CNS). This definition recognizes the central origin of the dysfunction, thus distinguishing it from neuropathies and myopathies.</li>
      <li><strong>Developmental Delay:</strong> Failure of a child to reach developmental milestones of gross motor, fine motor, language, and social-adaptive skills at anticipated ages.</li>
      <li><strong>Neurologic Deficit:</strong> Abnormal functioning or lack of function of a part of the nervous system.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
    <p>With a prevalence of at least 1 to 2 cases per 1000 live births, CP is the most common childhood movement disorder. Approximately one-third of CP patients also have seizures, and approximately 60% are mentally retarded. Deafness, visual impairments, swallowing difficulty with concomitant aspiration, limb sensory impairments, and behavioral disturbances are common comorbidities. The effect of aggressive neonatal medical therapies on CP prevalence is unclear; improved premature infant outcomes may mitigate the impact of increased survival of very low-birth-weight infants.</p>
    <p>Most children with CP have no identifiable risk factors. Current research indicates that CP most likely is the result of antenatal insults. Difficulties during the pregnancy, delivery, and the perinatal period are thought to reflect these insults and are probably not the primary cause of CP.</p>
    <p>Cerebral palsy, or “static” encephalopathy, is the result of a one-time CNS insult. In contrast, progressive encephalopathies destroy brain function with time. The term static is misleading, however, because the manifestations of CP change with age. Contractures and postural deformities may become more severe with time or may improve with therapy. Also, a child’s changing developmental stages early in life can alter the expression of his or her neurologic deficits.</p>
    <p>Immaturity of the CNS at birth makes diagnosis of CP nearly impossible in a neonate. If a CNS insult is suspected, head imaging (by ultrasound or MRI) can be helpful in recognizing CP early. Possible imaging findings include periventricular leukomalacia, atrophy, or focal infarctions. Beyond infancy, CP is suspected when a child fails to meet anticipated developmental milestones. Examples of concerning findings are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A stepping response after age 3 months</li>
      <li>A Moro reflex beyond 6 months</li>
      <li>An asymmetrical tonic neck reflex beyond 6 months</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cerebral palsy can be classified in terms of physiologic, topographic, or functional categories. Physiologic descriptors identify the major motor abnormality and are divided into pyramidal (spastic) and extrapyramidal (nonspastic) categories. Extrapyramidal types can be subdivided further into choreoathetoid, ataxic, dystonic, or rigid types.</p>
    <p>The topographic classification categorizes CP types according to limb involvement. Hemiplegia refers to involvement of a single lateral side of the body, with greater impairment of the upper extremities than the lower extremities. Diplegia describes four-limb involvement, with greater impairment of the lower extremities. Spastic quadriplegia is four-limb involvement with significant impairment of all extremities, although the upper limbs may be less impaired than lower limbs. (The term paraplegia is reserved for spinal and lower motor neuron disorders.)</p>
    <p>The functional classification of CP relies on the “motor quotient” to place patients into minimal, mild, moderate, and severe (profound) categories. The motor quotient is derived by dividing the child’s “motor age” (ie, motor skills developmental age) with the chronologic age. A motor quotient of 75 to 100 represents minimal impairment, 55 to 70 mild impairment, 40 to 55 moderate impairment, and lesser quotients severe impairment. These categories help clinicians identify children with less obvious impairments so that early treatment can be provided.</p>
    <p>The evaluation of CP is based on the history and physical examination. The yield of diagnostic findings with brain imaging and metabolic or genetic testing is low but can be helpful in managing the patient, in future family planning, and in reassuring the parents. Identification of comorbid conditions includes cognitive testing for mental retardation and electroencephalography (EEG) for seizures.</p>
    <p>Treatment goals include maximizing motor function and preventing secondary handicaps. During the preschool years, the child’s communication ability is important. School performance and peer acceptance become important issues for older children. Physical therapy for motor deficits may be supplemented with pharmacologic and surgical interventions. Occupational therapy improves positioning and allows for better interaction with the environment and eases care as the child grows. The family’s psychological and social needs should not be overlooked; children may require extensive physical and emotional support.</p>
    <h3>Comprehension Questions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>A term infant requires resuscitation after a spontaneous vaginal delivery. The Apgar scores at 1, 5, and 10 minutes were 2, 7, and 9, respectively. The mother’s medical records show that she received routine prenatal care with normal prenatal ultrasonogram, triple screen, and glucose tolerance tests. The nurse tells you that the father seemed very agitated and mentioned “suing the obstetrician if the baby does not turn out normal.” Your examination of the baby reveals no abnormalities. In counseling the family, which of the following is most appropriate?
        <ol type="A">
          <li>Tell them that your examination findings indicate that everything is fine.</li>
          <li>Tell them that the low Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes indicate that the baby suffered perinatal asphyxia.</li>
          <li>Tell them that because the pregnancy was uncomplicated, any neurologic deficit that the baby may develop likely can be attributed to events occurring at delivery.</li>
          <li>Tell them that your examination findings are reassuring, and that you will perform a careful developmental assessment at every well-child visit.</li>
          <li>Avoid speaking to the parents until you have had a chance to speak with the obstetrician and to see the cord blood gas results.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>A 4-year-old child with CP comes to your clinic for the first time for a routine visit. He walks with the help of leg braces and a walker, and his speech is slurred and limited to short phrases. He has never been hospitalized and he does not have swallowing problems. He began walking at age 2.5 years, and he is unable to take off his clothes and use the toilet without help. On examination you find that the boy has only minimally increased tone in the upper extremities but good fine motor coordination; he has significantly increased tone and deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities. How would you categorize this child’s CP?
        <ol type="A">
          <li>Mild, diplegic</li>
          <li>Mild, hemiplegic</li>
          <li>Moderate, diplegic</li>
          <li>Moderate, quadriplegic</li>
          <li>Severe, diplegic</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>An infant girl is born via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 28-week gestation because of an incompetent cervix. Which of the following features of her clinical course in the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) is most likely to correlate with her clinical outcome 5 years from now?
        <ol type="A">
          <li>Administration of surfactant</li>
          <li>Apnea of prematurity</li>
          <li>Grade IV intraventricular hemorrhage</li>
          <li>Retinopathy of prematurity stage 1 on initial ophthalmologic examination</li>
          <li>Umbilical artery catheterization</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The parents of a 2-year-old girl, recent immigrants from Guatemala, bring their child to you for the first time. The child was born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, and her neonatal course was uneventful. She sat without support at 6 months of age, pulled to a stand at 10 months, and walked at 14 months. She has a 10-word vocabulary, is able to drink from a cup, and feeds herself with a spoon. A previous child in the family died at age 5 years from “heart trouble.” On physical examination, you note lower extremity contractures, hand stiffness, somewhat coarse facial features, and hepatosplenomegaly. The child’s growth is within normal limits, and her examination is otherwise normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step to diagnose this child’s condition?
        <ol type="A">
          <li>Abdominal computerized tomography (CT)</li>
          <li>Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</li>
          <li>Chromosomal analysis</li>
          <li>Tests for a storage disorder</li>
          <li>Thyroid function studies</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Answers</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>D.</strong> The Apgar score at 1 minute reflects the neonatal environment immediately prior to birth; the 5-minute score correlates the infant’s response to resuscitation. The Apgar scores are not an accurate reflection of morbidity. An examination is a better indicator of the child’s outcome, but CP cannot be ruled out on the basis of a normal neonatal physical examination. A discussion of the events of delivery is best left to the obstetrician; the majority of difficult deliveries are the result of a previously unidentified antenatal insult. However, avoidance of the parents will likely only further their anxiety and may impede your efforts to provide care for the child.</li>
      <li><strong>C.</strong> In diplegia all four extremities are affected, with greater impairment of the lower extremities. As most children walk by age 14 months, this child’s motor quotient is 14 months/30 months = 0.47, which classifies him as moderately impaired.</li>
      <li><strong>C.</strong> Intraventricular hemorrhage is a complication in preterm infants. It is associated with seizures, hydrocephalus, and periventricular leukomalacia. A grade IV bleed involves the brain parenchyma, putting this child at higher risk for neurodevelopmental handicap.</li>
      <li><strong>D.</strong> The enlarged liver and spleen, the coarse facies, and the history of death in a previous child from “heart trouble” point to a storage disorder. Her joint contractures and hand stiffness may be explained by an abnormal metabolism rather than a CNS deficit as in CP.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Clinical Pearls</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cerebral palsy is a disorder of movement or posture resulting from an insult to, or an anomaly of, the central nervous system.</li>
      <li>Most children with cerebral palsy have no identifiable risk factors for the disorder.</li>
      <li>Optimal treatment plans for cerebral palsy use a multidisciplinary approach.</li>

    <h2>Case 16: Cystic Fibrosis</h2>
    <p>A 5-year-old girl comes to your clinic for the first time with complaints of fever, malaise, and a cough for 2 days. She has a history of asthma for which she uses a steroid inhaler daily and an albuterol inhaler as needed. She has been tried on various over-the-counter cold and allergy remedies, but her respiratory symptoms have been worsening over the past several months. Her past medical history is notable for an episode of rectal prolapse and “sinusitis” during each of the past two winter seasons. Her mother also reports that her daughter has “always been small for her age.” Your examination reveals a moderately ill-appearing child whose height and weight are at the fifth percentile for age. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C) and respiratory rate 32 breaths/min. She has scant purulent rhinorrhea bilaterally, wheezy breath sounds in all lung fields, and diminished breath sounds on the right side. Heart sounds and capillary refill are normal, yet she has digital clubbing.</p>
    <h3>Key Questions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the diagnostic approach in the evaluation of this child?</li>
      <li>What is the most likely diagnosis?</li>
      <li>What is the next step in evaluation?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Answers to Case 16: Cystic Fibrosis</h3>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A small-appearing, 5-year-old girl previously diagnosed with asthma, rectal prolapse, and sinusitis presents with fever, scant purulent rhinorrhea, abnormal breath sounds, and digital clubbing.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Diagnostic approach:</strong> Gather perinatal, past medical, family, and dietary histories, and a thorough systems review. Plot the child’s height and weight on a standard growth curve.</li>
      <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Cystic fibrosis (CF).</li>
      <li><strong>Next step in evaluation:</strong> Obtain a chest radiograph and perform a sweat chloride test.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Know the historical clues and physical signs to distinguish CF from more common conditions.</li>
      <li>Know how to accurately diagnose CF.</li>
      <li>Have a basic understanding of the implications and limitations of genetic testing for CF.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Considerations</h4>
    <p>A careful review of this child’s frequency and severity of respiratory symptoms, response to medications, and general health is warranted. Her small size and digital clubbing (unusual findings for asthma) suggest alternative diagnoses for her respiratory problems. Recurrent sinusitis is uncommon in young children because their nasal passages are not fully pneumatized; this girl likely was incorrectly diagnosed or has an underlying, predisposing condition for this problem.</p>
    <h3>Approach to Cystic Fibrosis</h3>
    <h4>Definitions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clubbing:</strong> Increase in the angle between the nail and nail base of 180° or greater, and softening of the nail base to palpation. Although the condition can be familial, clubbing is uncommon in children, usually indicating chronic pulmonary, hepatic, cardiac, or gastrointestinal disease.</li>
      <li><strong>Cystic Fibrosis (CF):</strong> The major cause of chronic debilitating pulmonary disease and pancreatic exocrine deficiency in the first three decades of life. It is characterized by the triad of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pancreatic exocrine deficiency, and abnormally high sweat electrolyte concentrations. Characteristic pancreatic changes give the disease its name.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
    <p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) afflicts 1 of 3300 whites, 1 of 16,300 African Americans, and 1 of 32,100 Asian Americans. It almost always involves the respiratory tract; most patients develop bronchiectasis by age 18 months, although some may not experience respiratory difficulty for several years. Children are commonly misdiagnosed as asthmatic, but a careful history and physical examination ultimately demonstrates clues of CF. Persistent bronchial obstruction from impaired mucus secretion predisposes patients to secondary bacterial infection, which leads to a cycle of inflammation, tissue damage, further obstruction, and chronic infection. Bacterial pneumonia is initially caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and then by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most patients with advanced disease harbor heavy, slime-producing mucoid variants of P aeruginosa, rarely found in other conditions. Once established, these bacteria are virtually impossible to eradicate. Colonization with Burkholderia cepacia may be associated with rapid clinical deterioration.</p>
    <p>Airway reactivity is present in 50% of patients, but bronchodilator response is unpredictable and varies. Pneumothorax, hemoptysis, and cor pulmonale are frequent complications with advanced disease; pulmonary problems ultimately cause respiratory and cardiac failure. Chronic nasal congestion and sinus opacification is common, but acute sinusitis occurs infrequently. Children with CF may develop nasal polyps, with resultant nasal obstruction, headaches, and mouth breathing.</p>
    <p>Children with CF grow poorly due to maldigestion from exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. They may have abdominal distention, rectal prolapse, subcutaneous fat and muscle tissue deficiency, and frequent passage of oily, malodorous stools; these stools predispose to obstruction, volvulus, or intussusception.</p>
    <p>Fatty liver infiltration or focal biliary cirrhosis occurs in many CF patients. Hepatomegaly, esophageal varices, and hypersplenism caused by portal hypertension develop in a small proportion of teens; neonates may have prolonged jaundice. Gallbladder disease is common in adults. Abdominal pain is relatively common. Other symptoms are azoospermia, enlarged submaxillary glands, osteoarthropathy, and a “salty taste” on the skin (due to eccrine sweat gland dysfunction). Patients and their families require extensive psychosocial support.</p>
    <p>The diagnosis of CF is usually based on a positive sweat test in conjunction with one of the following: typical chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, documented exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and/or a positive family history. Persons with CF have elevated sweat electrolyte concentrations because of abnormalities in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Appropriate technique is important when attempting to measure sweat chloride in infants, in whom the collection of an adequate sweat quantity may be difficult. Elevated sweat electrolyte levels (false positives) have been reported in conditions such as anorexia nervosa, hypothyroidism, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. False-negative results can occur in CF patients with edema and hypoproteinemia. Because the implications of false test results are great, sweat testing is most appropriately obtained when a reasonable clinical suspicion of CF exists and repeated when the initial test results are in doubt.</p>
    <p>Genetic CF testing may be used when CF is suspected but the results of sweat testing are negative or equivocal. Disease is caused by long arm of chromosome 7 mutations, the most common being a single phenylalanine deletion at amino acid 508 (Δ508). Available tests detect more than 90% of individuals who carry two CF gene mutations; some children have only one or no detectable mutations by this methodology.</p>
    <p>Because research demonstrates that newborn screening improves nutritional status, growth, and reduces hospitalizations, routine testing for CF is now performed for all newborns in most states in the United States. The blood spot screening test detects the pancreatic enzyme immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT), which is elevated in infants with CF. Second-tier testing for samples with high IRT levels relies on a second IRT test or DNA testing. Infants with positive results on the newborn screen undergo sweat chloride testing for definitive confirmation. False-negative results are possible with the IRT newborn screen, so infants with symptoms suggestive of CF (such as meconium ileus) should undergo further testing even if newborn screen results are negative.</p>
    <p>Long-term management of CF patients is best coordinated by experienced pediatric pulmonary specialists and includes minimizing airway reactivity and infections, optimizing nutritional status, and providing ongoing psychosocial support. The prognosis varies depending on disease severity. Infants with severe lung disease can die in early childhood, but most patients reach adolescence or adulthood. Mean survival for persons with CF now exceeds 35 years. Male survival is slightly longer than female, for reasons that are poorly understood; children from socioeconomically disadvantaged homes have a poorer prognosis.</p>
