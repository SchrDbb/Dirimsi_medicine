// env.js
// This file is used by specific development environments (like Canvas)
// to inject Firebase configuration and authentication tokens at runtime.
//
// When deployed to Firebase Hosting, Firebase SDKs automatically connect
// to the associated Firebase project. Therefore, no explicit configuration
// is needed in this file for your live hosted website.
//
// Do NOT manually add your Firebase project's API keys or sensitive info here
// if this file will be part of your public repository.
