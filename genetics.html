                <h3>1.1 Development of Medical Genetics</h3>
                <p>The speciality of medical genetics studies human biological variation and its relationship to health and disease, encompassing inheritance mechanisms, cytogenetics, molecular genetics, biochemical genetics, and population genetics. Clinical genetics focuses on diagnosing and managing genetic disorders in individuals and families.</p>
                <p>Genetic counselling clinics began in the USA in 1941 and the UK in 1946, initially addressing conditions like skin color, eye color, twinning, and rhesus haemolytic disease. Today, common referrals include mental retardation, neural tube defects, and Huntington disease. Key milestones include Mendel’s 1865 inheritance patterns, Garrod’s 1902 recognition of alkaptonuria as an autosomal recessive disorder, and the Hardy–Weinberg principle in 1908 for calculating carrier frequencies. DNA was discovered by Meischer in 1867, chromosomes illustrated by Fleming in 1882, and the human chromosome number established in 1956. The DNA structure was elucidated by Watson and Crick in 1953, with the genetic code cracked by 1966. Advances like restriction endonucleases and Southern blotting in the 1970s enabled gene mapping, culminating in the 2000 human genome draft sequence.</p>

                <h3>1.2 Genetic Disease</h3>
                <p>Genetic disorders impose significant health and economic burdens on individuals, families, and communities. Despite reduced perinatal mortality, lethal malformations in newborns remain constant, with 2–5% of liveborn infants having genetic disorders or congenital malformations. These account for one-third of pediatric ward admissions and contribute to perinatal and childhood mortality. Many adult diseases, such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, have a genetic predisposition.</p>
                <p>Single gene disorders, though individually rare, are numerous, with thousands described. They are often severe, incurable, and focus on prevention. Increased awareness of genetic contributions to disease drives demand for specialist clinical genetic services.</p>

                <p>In the UK, NHS genetic services operate through regional centres in teaching hospitals, integrating clinical and laboratory services with academic human genetics departments. Clinical geneticists, specialist registrars, and genetic associates provide services, often through a “hub and spoke” model, with clinics in district hospitals. Genetic associates conduct home visits to explain clinic processes, gather family history, and support counselling. Referrals address diagnosis, counselling, family investigations, and prenatal diagnosis for disorders like chromosomal syndromes, Mendelian, mitochondrial, and multifactorial conditions.</p>

                <h3>1.4 Cytogenetics</h3>
                <p>Cytogenetic laboratories analyze chromosomes from samples like blood, amniotic fluid, chorionic villus, or bone marrow to diagnose disorders, identify carriers of familial rearrangements, or inform therapy in neoplastic conditions. Routine analysis studies metaphase chromosomes in cultured cells, with results in 1–3 weeks. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) enables rapid diagnosis, such as for trisomy 21.

                <p>Molecular genetic laboratories offer DNA tests for diagnosis, presymptomatic testing, carrier detection, and prenatal diagnosis. Tests for rare disorders are conducted at designated labs. DNA is extracted from blood, buccal samples, or stored tissue, and frozen samples can be stored indefinitely. Gene tracking using linked DNA markers is used when direct mutation analysis is unavailable. Information is available at www.cmgs.org.uk.</p>

        <h1>Genetics of Unusual Inheritance Mechanisms</h1>

        <section id="unstable-mutations">
            <h2>Unstable Mutations</h2>
            <p>It has generally been assumed that mutant alleles causing mendelian disorders are transmitted unchanged from parent to child. In 1991 the discovery of unstable trinucleotide repeat expansion mutations identified a novel genetic mechanism underlying a number of important disorders.</p>
            <p>Several genes are known to contain regions of trinucleotide repeats. The number of repeats varies from person to person in the general population, but within the normal range these repeats are stably transmitted. When the number of repeats is increased beyond the normal range, this region becomes unstable with a tendency to increase in size when transmitted to offspring. In some conditions there is a clear distinction between normal and pathological alleles. In others, the expanded alleles may act either as premutations or as full pathological mutations. Premutations do not cause disease but are unstable and likely to expand further when transmitted to offspring. Once the repeat reaches a certain size it becomes a full mutation and disease will occur. Since the age at onset and severity of the disease correlate with the size of the expansion, this phenomenon accounts for the clinical anticipation that is seen in this group of conditions, where age at onset decreases in successive generations of a family. There is a sex bias in the transmission of the most severe forms of some of these disorders, with maternal transmission of congenital myotonic dystrophy and fragile X syndrome, but paternal transmission of juvenile Huntington disease.</p>
            <p>A number of late onset neurodegenerative disorders (for example Huntington disease and spinocerebellar ataxias) are associated with expansions of a CAG repeat sequence in the coding region of the relevant gene, that is translated into polyglutamine tracts in the protein product. These mutations confer a specific gain of function and cause the protein to form intranuclear aggregates that result in cell death. There is usually a clear distinction between normal- and disease-causing alleles in the size of their respective number of repeats and no other types of mutation are found to cause these disorders.</p>
            <p>In other disorders (for example fragile X syndrome and Friedreich ataxia) very large expansions occur, which prevent transcription of the gene, and act recessively as loss of function mutations. Other types of mutations occur occasionally in these genes resulting in the same phenotype. In myotonic dystrophy the pathological mechanism of the expanded repeat is not known. It is likely that the expansion affects the transcriptional process of several neighbouring genes. Juvenile myoclonus epilepsy is due to the expansion of a longer repeat region (CCCCGCCCCGCG) normally present in two to three copies in the gene promoter region, expanding to 40 or more repeats in mutant alleles.</p>
            <p>Trinucleotide repeat expansions have also been found in other conditions (for example polysyndactyly from HOXD13 mutation), where the pathological expansion shows no instability.</p>

        <section id="uniparental-disomy">
            <h2>Uniparental Disomy</h2>
            <p>Another unusual mechanism causing human disease is that of uniparental disomy (UPD), where both copies of a particular chromosome are inherited from one parent and none from the other. Usually, UPD arises by loss of a chromosome from a conception that was initially trisomic (trisomy rescue). The resulting zygote could contain one chromosome from each parent (normal), two identical chromosomes from one parent (isodisomy) or two different chromosomes from one parent (heterodisomy). Occasionally UPD may arise by fertilisation of a monosomic gamete followed by duplication of the chromosome from the other gamete (monosomy rescue). This mechanism results in uniparental isodisomy. Theoretically, UPD could also arise by fertilisation of a monosomic gamete with a disomic gamete, resulting in either isodisomy or heterodisomy.</p>
            <p>Uniparental disomy may have no clinical consequence by itself. It is occasionally detected by the unmasking of a recessive disorder for which only one parent is a carrier when there is isodisomy for the parental chromosome carrying such a mutation. In this rare situation the child would be affected by a recessive disorder for which the other parent is not a carrier. Recurrence risk for the disorder in siblings is extremely low since UPD is not likely to occur again in another pregnancy.</p>
            <p>The other situation in which UPD will have an effect is when the chromosome involved contains one or more imprinted genes, as described in the next section.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="imprinting">
            <h2>Imprinting</h2>
            <p>It has been observed that some inherited traits do not conform to the pattern expected of classical mendelian inheritance in which genes inherited from either parent have an equal effect. The term imprinting is used to describe the phenomenon by which certain genes function differently, depending on whether they are maternally or paternally derived. The mechanism of DNA modification involved in imprinting remains to be explained, but it confers a functional change in particular alleles at the time of gametogenesis determined by the sex of the parent. The imprint lasts for one generation and is then removed, so that an appropriate imprint can be re-established in the germ cells of the next generation.</p>
            <p>The effects of imprinting can be observed at several levels: that of the whole genome, that of particular chromosomes or chromosomal segments, and that of individual genes. For example, the effect of triploidy in human conceptions depends on the origin of the additional haploid chromosome set. When paternally derived, the placenta is large and cystic with molar changes and the fetus has a large head and small body. When the extra chromosome set is maternal, the placenta is small and underdeveloped without cystic changes and the fetus is noticeably underdeveloped. An analogous situation is seen in conceptions with only a maternal or paternal genetic contribution. Androgenic conceptions, arising by replacement of the female pronucleus with a second male pronucleus, give rise to hydatidiform moles which lack embryonic tissues. Gynogenetic conceptions, arising by replacement of the male pronucleus with a second female one, results in dermoid cysts that develop into multitissue ovarian teratomas.</p>
            <p>One of the best examples of imprinting in human disease is shown by deletions in the q11-13 region of chromosome 15, which may cause either Prader–Willi syndrome or Angelman syndrome. The features of Prader–Willi syndrome are severe neonatal hypotonia and failure to thrive with later onset of obesity, behaviour problems, mental retardation, characteristic facial appearance, small hands and feet and hypogonadism. Angelman syndrome is quite distinct and is associated with severe mental retardation, microcephaly, ataxia, epilepsy and absent speech.</p>
            <p>Prader–Willi and Angelman syndromes are caused by distinct genes within the 15q11-13 region that are subject to different imprinting. The Prader–Willi gene is only active on the chromosome inherited from the father and the Angelman syndrome gene is only active on the chromosome inherited from the mother. Similar de novo cytogenetic or molecular deletions can be detected in both conditions. Prader–Willi syndrome occurs when the deletion affects the paternally derived chromosome 15, whereas the Angelman syndrome occurs when it affects the maternally derived chromosome. In most patients with Prader–Willi syndrome who do not have a chromosome deletion, both chromosome 15s are maternally derived (uniparental disomy). When UPD involves imprinted regions of the genome it has the same effect as a chromosomal deletion arising from the opposite parental chromosome. In Prader–Willi syndrome both isodisomy (inheritance of identical chromosome 15s from one parent) and heterodisomy (inheritance of different 15s from the same parent) have been observed. Uniparental disomy is rare in Angelman syndrome, but when it occurs it involves disomy of the paternal chromosome 15. Other cases are due to mutations within the Angelman syndrome gene (UBE3A) that affect its function.</p>
            <p>Imprinting has been implicated in other human diseases, for example familial glomus tumours that occur only in people who inherit the mutant gene from their father and Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome that occurs when maternally transmitted.</p>

        <section id="mosaicism">
            <h2>Mosaicism</h2>
            <p>Mosaicism refers to the presence of two or more cell lines in an individual that differ in chromosomal constitution or genotype, but have been derived from a single zygote. Mosaicism may involve whole chromosomes or single gene mutations and is a postzygotic event that arises in a single cell. Once generated, the genetic change is transmitted to all daughter cells at cell division, creating a second cell line. The process can occur during early embryonic development, or in later fetal or postnatal life. The time at which the mosaicism develops will determine the relative proportions of the two cell lines, and hence the severity of the phenotype caused by the abnormal cell line. Chimaeras have a different origin, being derived from the fusion of two different zygotes to form a single embryo. Chimaerism explains the rare occurrence of both XX and XY cell lines in a single individual.</p>
            <p>Functional mosaicism occurs in all females as only one X chromosome remains active in each cell. The process of X inactivation occurs in early embryogenesis and is random. Thus, alleles that differ between the two chromosomes will be expressed in mosaic fashion. Carriers of X linked recessive mutations normally remain asymptomatic as only a proportion of cells have the mutant allele on the active chromosome. Occasional females will, by chance, have the normal X chromosome inactivated in the majority of cells and will then manifest systemic symptoms of the disorder caused by the mutant gene. In X linked dominant disorders such as incontinentia pigmenti, female gene carriers have patchy skin pigmentation that follows Blaschko’s lines because of the mixture of normal and mutant cells in the skin during development.</p>
            <p>Chromosomal mosaicism is not infrequent, and arises by postzygotic errors in mitosis. Mosaicism is observed in conditions such as Turner syndrome and Down syndrome, and the phenotype is less severe than in cases with complete aneuploidy. Mosaicism has been documented for many other numerical or structural chromosomal abnormalities that would be lethal in non-mosaic form. The clinical importance of chromosomal mosaicism detected prenatally may be difficult to assess. The abnormal karyotype detected by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling may be confined to placental cells, but even when present in the fetus the severity with which the fetus will be affected is difficult to predict.</p>
            <p>Single gene mutations occurring in somatic cells also result in mosaicism. In mendelian disorders this may present as a patchy phenotype, as in segmental neurofibromatosis type 1. Somatic mutation is also a mechanism responsible for neoplastic change.</p>
            <p>Germline mosaicism is one explanation for the transmission of a genetic disorder to more than one offspring by apparently normal parents. In these cases the mutation may be confined to the germline cells or may be present in a proportion of somatic cells as well. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, it has been calculated that up to 20% of the mothers of isolated cases, whose carrier tests performed on leucocyte DNA give normal results, may have gonadal mosaicism for the muscular dystrophy mutation. The possibility of germline mosaicism makes it difficult to exclude a risk of recurrence in other X linked recessive disorders where the mother’s carrier tests give normal results, and autosomal dominant disorders where the parents are clinically unaffected.</p>

        <section id="mitochondrial-disorders">
            <h2>Mitochondrial Disorders</h2>
            <p>Not all DNA is contained within the cell nucleus. Mitochondria have their own DNA consisting of a double-stranded circular molecule. This mitochondrial DNA consists of 16,569 base pairs that constitute 37 genes. There is some difference in the genetic code between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, and mitochondrial DNA is almost exclusively coding, with the genes containing no intervening sequences (introns). A diploid cell contains two copies of the nuclear genome, but there may be thousands of copies of the mitochondrial genome, as each mitochondrion contains up to 10 copies of its circular DNA and each cell contains hundreds of mitochondria. The mitochondrial genome encodes 22 types of transfer and two ribosomal RNA molecules that are involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis, as well as 13 of the polypeptides involved in the respiratory chain complex. The remaining respiratory chain polypeptides are encoded by nuclear genes. Diseases affecting mitochondrial function may therefore be controlled by nuclear gene mutation and follow mendelian inheritance, or may result from mutations within the mitochondrial DNA.</p>
            <p>Mutations within mitochondrial DNA appear to be 5 or 10 times more common than mutations in nuclear DNA, and the accumulation of mitochondrial mutations with time has been suggested as playing a role in ageing. As the main function of mitochondria is the synthesis of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, disorders of mitochondrial function are most likely to affect tissues such as the brain, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and eye, which contain abundant mitochondria and rely on aerobic oxidation and ATP production. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA have been identified in a number of diseases, notably Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibres (MERRF), mitochondrial myopathy with encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), and progressive external ophthalmoplegia including Kaerns–Sayre syndrome.</p>
            <p>Disorders due to mitochondrial mutations often appear to be sporadic. When they are inherited, however, they demonstrate maternal transmission. This is because only the egg contributes cytoplasm and mitochondria to the zygote. All offspring of a carrier mother may carry the mutation, all offspring of a carrier father will be normal. The pedigree pattern in mitochondrial inheritance may be difficult to recognise, however, because some carrier individuals remain asymptomatic. In Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, which causes sudden and irreversible blindness, for example, half the sons of a carrier mother are affected, but only 1 in 5 of the daughters become symptomatic. Nevertheless, all daughters transmit the mutation to their offspring. The descendants of affected fathers are unaffected.</p>
            <p>Because multiple copies of mitochondrial DNA are present in the cell, mitochondrial mutations are often heteroplasmic – that is, a single cell will contain a mixture of mutant and wild-type mitochondrial DNA. With successive cell divisions some cells will remain heteroplasmic but others may drift towards homoplasmy for the mutant or wild-type DNA. Large deletions, which make the remaining mitochondrial DNA appreciably shorter, may have a selective advantage in terms of replication efficiency, so that the mutant genome accumulates preferentially. The severity of disease caused by mitochondrial mutations probably depends on the relative proportions of wild-type and mutant DNA present, but is very difficult to predict in a given subject.</p>

        <section id="risk-estimation">
            <h2>Risk Estimation in Mendelian Disorders</h2>
            <p>This chapter gives some examples of simple risk calculations in mendelian disorders. Risks may be related to the probability of a person developing a disorder or to the probability of transmitting it to their offspring. Mathematical risk calculated from the pedigree data may often be modified by additional information, such as biochemical test results. In an increasing number of disorders, gene carriers can be identified with certainty by gene mutation analysis. Risk calculation remains important, since decisions about whether to proceed with a genetic test are often influenced by the level of risk determined from the pedigree.</p>
            <p>Risks or probabilities are usually expressed in terms of a percentage (i.e. 25%) a fraction (i.e. 1/4 or 1 in 4) or as odds (i.e. 3 to 1 against or 1 to 3 in favour) of a particular outcome.</p>
            <h3>Autosomal Dominant Disorders</h3>
            <p>Many autosomal dominant disorders have onset in adult life and are not apparent clinically during childhood. In such families a clinically unaffected adolescent or young adult has a high risk of carrying the gene, but an unaffected elderly relative is unlikely to do so. The prior risk of 50% for developing the disorder can therefore be modified by age. Data are available for Huntington disease from which age-related risks can be derived for clinically unaffected relatives. The risk of developing Huntington disease for individual B is still almost 50% at the age of 30. Risk to offspring C is therefore 25%. In another example, individual B remains unaffected at the age of 60 and her residual risk is reduced to around 20%. Risk to offspring C at the age of 40 is reduced to around 5% after his own age-related risk adjustment.</p>
            <p>When both parents are affected by the same autosomal dominant disorder the risk of having affected children is high. The chance of a child being unaffected is only 1 in 4. The risk of a child being an affected heterozygote is 1 in 2 and of being an affected homozygote is 1 in 4. In most conditions, the phenotype in homozygous individuals is more severe than that in heterozygotes, as seen in familial hypercholesterolaemia and achondroplasia.</p>
            <p>Reduced penetrance also modifies simple autosomal dominant risk. Reduced penetrance refers to the situation in which not all carriers of a particular dominant gene mutation will develop clinical signs or symptoms. Genes demonstrating reduced penetrance include tuberous sclerosis, retinoblastoma and otosclerosis.</p>
            <h3>Autosomal Recessive Disorders</h3>
            <p>Recurrence of autosomal recessive disorders generally occurs only within one particular sibship in a family. Occurrence of the same disorder in different sibships within an extended family can occur if the mutant gene is common in the population, or there is multiple consanguinity. Many members of the family will, however, be gene carriers and may wish to know the risk for their own children being affected.</p>
            <p>The risk of an unaffected sibling having an affected child is low and is determined by the chance that their partner is also a carrier. The actual risk depends on the frequency of the mutant gene in the population. This can be calculated from the disease incidence using the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium principle. In general, doubling the square root of the disease incidence gives a sufficiently accurate estimation of carrier frequency in a given population.</p>
            <h3>X Linked Recessive Disorders</h3>
            <p>Calculation of risks in X linked recessive disorders is important since many female relatives may have a substantial carrier risk although they are usually completely healthy, and carriers have a high risk of transmitting the disorder irrespective of whom they marry. Calculation of risks is often complex and requires referral to a specialist genetic centre.</p>
            <p>In lethal X linked recessive disorders new mutations account for a third of all cases. When there is only one affected boy in a family, his mother is therefore not always a carrier. Carrier risks in families with an isolated case of such a disorder (for example Duchenne muscular dystrophy) can be modified by molecular analysis if the underlying mutation in the affected boy can be identified, or by serum creatine kinase levels in the female relatives.</p>
            <h3>Isolated Cases</h3>
            <p>Pedigrees showing only one affected person are the type most commonly encountered in clinical practice, since many cases present after the first affected family member is diagnosed. Various causes must be considered, and risk estimation in this situation depends entirely on reaching an accurate diagnosis in the affected person.</p>
            <p>There are several explanations to account for isolated cases of an autosomal dominant disorder. These include new mutation and non-paternity. Recurrence risks are negligible unless one parent is a non-penetrant gene carrier or has a mutation restricted to germline cells.</p>

        <section id="carrier-detection">
            <h2>Carrier Detection</h2>
            <p>Identifying carriers of genetic disorders in families or populations at risk plays an important part in preventing genetic disease. A carrier is a healthy person who possesses the mutant gene for an inherited disorder in the heterozygous state, which they may transmit to their offspring. The implications for themselves and their offspring depend on whether the gene mutation acts in a dominant or recessive fashion.</p>
            <p>In recessive disorders gene carriers remain unaffected, but in late onset dominant conditions, gene carriers will be destined to develop the condition themselves at some stage. Autosomal recessive gene mutations are extremely common and everyone carries at least one gene for a recessive disorder and one or more that would be lethal in the homozygous state.</p>

            <h2>Single Gene Disorders</h2>
            <p>There are thousands of genetic traits and disorders described, some of which are exceedingly rare. All of the identified mendelian traits in man have been catalogued by McKusick and are listed on the Omim (online mendelian inheritance in man) database described in chapter 16. In this chapter the clinical and genetic aspects of a few examples of some of the more common disorders are briefly outlined and examples of genetic disorders affecting various organ systems are listed.</p>
            <h3>Huntington Disease</h3>
            <p>Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant disease characterised by progressive choreiform movements, rigidity, and dementia from selective, localised neuronal cell death associated with atrophy of the caudate nucleus demonstrated by CNS imaging. The frequency of clinical disease is about 6 per 100,000 with a frequency of heterozygotes of about 1 per 10,000. Development of frank chorea may be preceded by a prodromal period in which there are mild psychiatric and behavioural symptoms. The age of onset is often between 30 and 40 years, but can vary from the first to the seventh decade. The disorder is progressive, with death occurring about 15 years after onset of symptoms. Surprisingly, affected homozygotes are not more severely affected than heterozygotes and new mutations are exceedingly rare.</p>
            <p>The gene (designated IT15) for Huntington disease was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 4 in 1983, but not finally cloned until 1993. The mutation underlying Huntington disease is an expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat sequence. Normal alleles contain 9–35 copies of the repeat, whereas pathological alleles usually contain 37–86 repeats, but sometimes more. Transcription and translation of pathological alleles results in the incorporation of an expanded polyglutamine tract in the protein product (huntingtin) leading to accumulation of intranuclear aggregates and neuronal cell death.</p>
