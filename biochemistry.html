        <h2>Case 1: Sickle Cell Disease</h2>
        <p>A 15-year-old African-American female presents to the emergency room with complaints of bilateral thigh and hip pain. The pain has been present for 1 day and is steadily increasing in severity. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen have not relieved her symptoms. She denies any recent trauma or excessive exercise. She does report feeling fatigued and has been having burning with urination along with urinating frequently. She reports having similar pain episodes in the past, sometimes requiring hospitalization. On examination, she is afebrile (without fever) and in no acute distress. No one in her family has similar episodes. Her conjunctiva and mucosal membranes are slightly pale in coloration. She has nonspecific bilateral anterior thigh pain with no abnormalities appreciated. The remainder of her examination is completely normal. Her white blood cell count is elevated at 17,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, and her hemoglobin (Hb) level is decreased at 7.1 g/dL. The urinalysis demonstrated an abnormal number of numerous bacteria.</p>
        
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>◆ What is the most likely diagnosis?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>◆ What is the molecular genetics behind this disorder?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>◆ What is the pathophysiologic mechanism of her symptoms?</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Answers to Case 1: Sickle Cell Disease</h3>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 15-year-old African-American female with recurrent bilateral thigh and hip pain, anemia, and symptoms and laboratory evidence of a urinary tract infection.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Sickle cell disease (pain crisis).</li>
            <li><strong>Biochemical mechanism of disease:</strong> Single amino acid substitution on hemoglobin beta chain, inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion (1 of 12 African Americans in United States are carriers of the trait).</li>
            <li><strong>Pathophysiologic mechanism of symptoms:</strong> The sickled red blood cells cause infarction of bone, lung, kidney, and other tissue from vasoocclusion.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>This 15-year-old female’s description of her pain is typical of a sickle cell pain crisis. Many times, infection is a trigger, most commonly pneumonia or a urinary tract infection. This case is consistent with a urinary tract infection, indicated by her symptoms of urinary frequency, and burning with urination (dysuria). Her white blood cell count is elevated in response to the infection. The low hemoglobin level is consistent with sickle cell anemia. Since she is homozygous (both genes coding for sickle hemoglobin), both her parents have sickle cell trait (heterozygous) and thus do not have symptoms. The diagnosis can be established with hemoglobin electrophoresis. Treatment includes searching for an underlying cause of crisis (infection, hypoxia, fever, excessive exercise, and extreme changes in temperature), administration of oxygen, intravenous fluids for hydration, pain management, and consideration of a blood transfusion.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Allosteric effectors:</strong> Molecules that bind to enzymes or protein carriers at sites other than the active or ligand binding site. On binding, allosteric effectors either positively or negatively affect the enzymatic activity or capability of the protein to bind its ligand.</li>
            <li><strong>Globin:</strong> The globular proteins that are the polypeptide components of myoglobin and hemoglobin. They contain a hydrophobic pocket that holds the heme prosthetic group.</li>
            <li><strong>Globin fold:</strong> The three-dimensional structure of the proteins that is common to myoglobin and the subunits of hemoglobin.</li>
            <li><strong>Heme:</strong> A porphyrin ring that has a Fe<sup>+2</sup> ion coordinately bound in the center of the molecule. Heme binds oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin and serves as an electron carrier in the cytochromes.</li>
            <li><strong>Hemoglobin:</strong> The tetrameric protein in high concentration in red blood cells that binds oxygen in the capillaries of the lungs and delivers it to peripheral tissues. Each globin subunit contains a heme group that binds oxygen when the iron atom is in the ferrous (+2) oxidation state.</li>
            <li><strong>Myoglobin:</strong> A protein having a single globin polypeptide with a bound heme group. It is located primarily in muscle cells and stores oxygen for times when there is a high demand for energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Protein primary (I°) structure:</strong> The amino acid sequence of the protein, listed from the amino-terminal amino acid to the carboxy-terminal amino acid.</li>
            <li><strong>Protein secondary (II°) structure:</strong> The local three-dimensional spatial arrangement of amino acids close to one another in the primary sequence. α-Helices and β-sheets are the predominant secondary structures in proteins.</li>
            <li><strong>Protein tertiary (III°) structure:</strong> The overall three-dimensional structure of a single polypeptide chain, including positions of disulfide bonds. Noncovalent forces such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic forces, and hydrophobic effects are also important.</li>
            <li><strong>Protein quaternary (IV°) structure:</strong> The overall three-dimensional arrangement of polypeptide subunits in a multi-subunit protein.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Discussion</h4>
        <p>The activity of a given protein is dependent on proper folding of its polypeptide chain to assume a defined three-dimensional structure. The importance of protein folding to molecular medicine is emphasized by the fact that many disease-causing mutations do not directly affect the active or ligand binding site of proteins, but instead cause local or global alterations in protein structure or disrupt the folding pathway such that the native protein fold is not achieved, or undesirable interactions with other proteins are promoted. The molecular defect that changes adult hemoglobin (HbA) to sickle hemoglobin (HbS), leading to sickle cell anemia, is a classic example of mutations that affect protein structure.</p>
        <p>Protein structure is typically classified as consisting of four levels: primary (I°), secondary (II°), tertiary (III°), and quaternary (IV°). Primary structure is the sequence of amino acids in the protein. Secondary structure is the local three-dimensional spatial arrangement of amino acids that are close to one another in the primary sequence. α-Helices and β-sheets compose the majority of secondary structures in all known proteins. Tertiary structure is the spatial arrangement of amino acid residues that are far apart in the linear primary sequence of a single polypeptide chain, and it includes disulfide bonds and noncovalent forces. These noncovalent forces include hydrogen bonding, which is also the primary stabilization force for the formation of α-helices and β-sheets, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic effects. Quaternary structure is the manner in which subunits of a multi-subunit protein are arranged with respect to one another.</p>
        <p>Normal hemoglobin has four subunits called globins. Adult hemoglobin has two α (α1 and α2) and two β (β1 and β2) globin chains. Each globin chain has an associated heme prosthetic group, which is the site of oxygen binding and release. All globin chains have similar primary sequences. The secondary structure of globin chains consists of approximately 75 percent α-helix. The similar primary sequence promotes a similar tertiary structure in all globins that is called the globin fold, which is compact and globular in overall conformation. The quaternary structure of HbA can be described as a dimer of α1β1 and α2β2 dimers. The αβ dimers move relative to one another during the binding and release of oxygen.</p>
        <p>Hemoglobin must remain soluble at high concentrations within the red blood cell to support normal oxygen binding and release properties. This is made possible by a distribution of amino acid side chains in which hydrophobic residues are sequestered in the interior core of the folded globin subunits, while hydrophilic residues dominate the water-exposed surface of the globin fold. The disk-shaped heme prosthetic group is inserted into a hydrophobic pocket formed by the globin.</p>
        <p>Hemoglobin, and the homologous monomeric protein myoglobin (Mb), both bind and release oxygen as a function of the surrounding concentration, or partial pressure of oxygen. A plot of percent saturation of Hb or Mb with oxygen versus the partial pressure of oxygen is called the oxygen dissociation curve. Unlike Mb, which has a simple hyperbolic oxygen dissociation curve typical of ligand binding to a monomeric protein, the quaternary structure of HbA allows it to bind oxygen with positive cooperativity giving a sigmoidal oxygen dissociation curve (Figure 1-1). Essentially, binding of oxygen to one HbA subunit increases the affinity of binding to other subunits in the tetramer, thereby shifting the equilibrium between oxy and deoxy forms. The net effect of this cooperativity is that HbA is able to release oxygen, whereas Mb globin would be most saturated with oxygen at the partial pressure of oxygen normally found in resting peripheral tissues. The quaternary structure of HbA also allows it to respond to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen ion, all of which are heterotropic negative allosteric effectors of oxygen binding.</p>
        <p>Sickle cell anemia results from the nonconservative substitution of valine for glutamate at residue 6 (Val-6) in the β-chain of hemoglobin. The mutated hemoglobin is called HbS. The intrinsic oxygen binding properties of HbA and HbS are the same, however, the solubility of deoxy HbS is reduced because of exposure of Val-6 at the surface of the β-chain. Since hemoglobin is present at very high concentrations in the red blood cell, deoxy HbS will precipitate inside the cell. The precipitate takes the form of elongated fibers because of the association of complementary hydrophobic surfaces on the β- and α-chains of deoxy HbS. At oxygen saturations found in arterial blood, the oxy HbS predominates and HbS does not precipitate because Val-6 of the β-chain is not exposed to the surface.</p>
        <p>The tendency for deoxy HbS to precipitate is why clinical manifestations of sickle cell anemia are brought on by exertion and why treatment includes administration of oxygen. The stiff fibrous precipitate causes the red blood cell to deform into the characteristic sickle shape and makes the normally malleable cell susceptible to hemolysis.</p>

        <h4>Comprehension Questions</h4>
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>[1.1]</strong> A newly married African-American couple, both from families having histories of good health, are about to have a child. If the incidence of the sickle cell trait is approximately 1/12 among persons of African descent in the United States, what is the chance that they will give birth to a child that is affected by sickle cell disease?</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>1/12</li>
                <li>1/24</li>
                <li>1/96</li>
                <li>1/288</li>
                <li>1/576</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer: E.</strong> Since sickle cell anemia has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and the incidence in the United States to persons of African descent is approximately 1/12, then each parent has a 1/12 chance of being a carrier. Since it is an autosomal recessive gene, then their offspring would have a 1/4 chance of being homozygous if both of their parents were also carriers. Thus, the chances of having a child with the sickle cell trait is (1/12)(1/12)(1/4) or 1/576.</p>
        
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>[1.2]</strong> A 25-year-old African-American male with sickle cell anemia, who has been hospitalized several times for painful sickle cell crises, has successfully been free of these crises since he has been on hydroxyurea therapy. Treatment with hydroxyurea results in which of the following?</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>An increase in the oxygen affinity of HbS</li>
                <li>An increase in the levels of hemoglobin F (HbF) in red blood cells</li>
                <li>A decreased cooperativity in oxygen binding by HbS</li>
                <li>A posttranslational modification of HbS that prevents polymerization</li>
                <li>A decreased ability of HbS to bind 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer: B.</strong> By inhibiting the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, hydroxyurea has been shown to increase the levels of fetal Hb (HbF, α2γ2) by mechanisms not fully understood. The increase in HbF concentrations has the effect of decreasing HbS levels in the red blood cell. The increased concentration of HbF disrupts the polymerization of HbS and decreases the incidence of sickle cell crises. Hydroxyurea does not affect either the oxygen affinity or cooperativity of oxygen binding of HbS, nor does it react with HbS to cause a posttranslational modification or affect 2,3-BPG binding.</p>
        
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>[1.3]</strong> A pregnant woman is able to transfer oxygen to her fetus because fetal hemoglobin has a greater affinity for oxygen than does adult hemoglobin. Why is the affinity of fetal hemoglobin for oxygen higher?</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>The tense form of hemoglobin is more prevalent in the circulation of the fetus.</li>
                <li>There is less 2,3-BPG in the fetal circulation as compared to maternal circulation.</li>
                <li>Fetal hemoglobin binds 2,3-BPG with fewer ionic bonds than the adult form.</li>
                <li>The Bohr effect is enhanced in the fetus.</li>
                <li>The oxygen-binding curve of fetal hemoglobin is shifted to the right.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer: C.</strong> In adult hemoglobin 2,3-BPG binds to ionized residues in the interface between the two β-chains, thus decreasing the oxygen affinity. The γ-chains of fetal hemoglobin have fewer ionized residues in the corresponding interface and bind 2,3-BPG with less affinity, which allows for a greater binding affinity for oxygen.</p>
        
        <h4>Biochemistry Pearls</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The quaternary structure of HbA allows it to bind oxygen with positive cooperativity giving a sigmoidal oxygen dissociation curve.</li>
            <li>Sickle cell anemia results from the nonconservative substitution of valine for glutamate at the sixth residue of the β-chain of hemoglobin.</li>
            <li>Precipitation of HbS is more likely to occur from exertion and deoxygenation. Treatment consists therefore of oxygen and hydration.</li>
            <li>The stiff fibrous precipitate of HbS causes the red blood cell to deform into the characteristic sickle shape and makes the normally malleable cell susceptible to hemolysis.</li>

        <h2>Case 2: Ribavirin and Influenza</h2>
        <p>A 21-year-old college student presents to the clinic complaining of a sudden onset of chills and fever, muscle aches, headache, fatigue, sore throat, and painful nonproductive cough 3 days prior to fall final exams. Numerous friends of the patient in the dormitory reported similar symptoms and were given the diagnosis of influenza. He said that some of them were given a prescription for ribavirin. On examination, he appears ill with temperature 39.4°C (103°F). His skin is warm to the touch, but no rashes are appreciated. The patient has mild cervical lymph node enlargement but otherwise has a normal examination.</p>

        <h3>Answers to Case 2: Ribavirin and Influenza</h3>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A college student complains of the sudden onset of fever, chills, malaise, nonproductive cough, and numerous sick contacts in the fall season.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Likely diagnosis:</strong> Acute influenza infection.</li>
            <li><strong>Biochemical mechanism of action of ribavirin:</strong> A nucleoside analogue with activity against a variety of viral infections.</li>
            <li><strong>Genetic makeup of organism:</strong> Ribonucleic acid (RNA) respiratory virus.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>This 21-year-old college student has the clinical clues suggestive of acute influenza. Typically, the illness occurs in the winter months with an acute onset of fever, myalgias (muscle aches), headache, cough, and sore throat. Usually, there are outbreaks with many individuals with the same symptoms. This patient is young and healthy, and antiviral therapy is not mandatory. The best way to prevent the infection is by influenza vaccination, usually given in October or November of each year. Because of the antigenic changes of the virus, a new vaccine must be given each year. Patients who are at especially high risk for severe complications or death should receive the vaccine each year. These include the elderly and people with asthma, chronic lung disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, diabetes, or chronic renal insufficiency.</p>

            <li><strong>Base pairing:</strong> The hydrogen bonds formed between complementary bases that are part of the polynucleotide chains of nucleic acids. The base pairing is specific in that adenine will base pair with thymine (uracil in RNA) and guanine will pair with cytosine.</li>
            <li><strong>Chargaff rule:</strong> The amount of adenine and thymine in DNA is equal; the amount of cytosine and guanine is equal. (A = T, C = G). The amount of purines equals the amount of pyrimidines.</li>

            <li><strong>Nucleotide:</strong> A nucleoside that has a phosphoester bond to one of the hydroxyl groups of the pentose sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Polymerase:</strong> An enzyme that will add nucleotides to a growing nucleic acid chain using a template strand to determine which nucleotide is added. A nucleoside triphosphate condenses with the growing strand releasing pyrophosphate.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h4>Discussion</h4>
        <p>DNA and RNA are both polymers of nucleosides joined by 3′,5′-phosphodiester linkages. Each nucleoside consists of a heterocyclic nitrogenous base in a glycosidic link with a pentose sugar. The backbone of both DNA and RNA is formed by the phosphate bridges between the 3′-hydroxyl group of one pentose and the 5′-hydroxyl group of another. The nitrogenous bases form the “side chains.” DNA contains the bases adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T), whereas RNA contains A, G, and C but has uracil (U) instead of T. The pentose sugar in DNA is 2′-deoxyribose, whereas in RNA it is ribose.</p>
        <p>The most stable DNA structure is formed when two polynucleotide chains are joined by hydrogen bonding between the side chain bases. The base pairing is specific in that adenine forms hydrogen bonds with thymine, whereas guanine forms hydrogen bonds with cytosine. The result is an antiparallel double helix in which one polynucleotide strand runs in the 5′ to 3′ direction, while the other runs in the 3′ to 5′ direction. The phosphate groups are located on the outside of the double helix with the base pairs forming the “stair steps” in the center of the spiral. RNA, on the other hand, is usually single stranded (the exception is certain RNA viruses), but the strand can loop back on itself and form regions of base pairing (A with U and G with C). The presence of the hydroxyl group at the 2′-position makes RNA much more susceptible to hydrolysis and decreases its stability.</p>
        <p>The double helical structure of DNA must be disrupted during almost all biological processes in which it participates, including DNA replication and repair, as well as transcription of the DNA sequence information to RNA. Experimentally, the double helix can be separated, or denatured, by increasing the temperature to well above 50°C (122°F). If the temperature is carefully decreased, renaturation occurs when the base pairs reform. Under these conditions, hybridization can be induced by allowing the single strands of DNA form base pairs with complementary base sequences on another strand of DNA or RNA. During replication, repair, and transcription, complex proteins (helicases during DNA replication, RNA polymerase during transcription) cause the separation of the two strands.</p>
        <p>The cellular DNA and RNA polymerases of higher organisms are much more accurate than those of viruses because of their high specificities and, in the case of DNA polymerases, proofreading capabilities. This accounts for the high degree of mutation in viruses. However, this can have therapeutic advantages. Ribavirin (1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) is a purine nucleoside analog exhibiting in vitro antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of DNA and RNA viruses. Ribavirin has shown clinical efficacy against both influenza A and B viruses. This antiviral activity is a result of the resemblance of this compound to nucleosides. Studies showed that ribavirin most closely resembles guanosine, as determined by x-ray crystallography (Figure 2-1). Once in cells, ribavirin is converted to its 5′-phosphate derivatives by cellular enzymes. The major metabolite is ribavirin-5′-triphosphate (RTP), and the intracellular concentration of the mono-, di-, and triphosphate derivatives probably is similar to that of other cellular nucleotides. Although not all polymerase/replication systems use ribavirin as they do guanosine, it has been shown that many of the systems that are inhibited by ribavirin are reversed by the addition of guanosine.</p>
        <p>Until 2001, it was thought that the mechanism of action of ribavirin involved a decrease in cellular guanosine triphosphate (GTP) pools resulting from inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase by ribavirin monophosphate. More recently, the mechanism of action for ribavirin has been expanded to include lethal mutagenesis of the viral genome as a result of ribavirin triphosphate utilization by the error-prone viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and incorporation of ribavirin into viral RNA.</p>

        <p>In 2001 a critical study published in Nature Medicine showed in vitro use of ribavirin triphosphate by a model viral RNA polymerase, poliovirus 3D pol. Ribavirin incorporation is mutagenic, because it serves as a template for incorporation of cytidine and uridine with equal efficiency (Figure 2-2). Ribavirin reduces infectious poliovirus production to as little as 0.00001 percent in cell culture. The antiviral activity of ribavirin correlates directly with its mutagenic activity. These data indicate that ribavirin forces the virus into “error catastrophe.” This study reveals a new concept about nucleoside analogs, that is, mutagenic ribonucleosides may represent an important class of anti-RNA virus agents.</p>
        <p>RNA viruses like HIV and the influenza virus use a naturally high mutation rate of their RNA polymerases with low fidelity for replication to avoid and escape most treatments and vaccines. A RNA virus tends to mistakenly insert ribavirin into newly synthesized copies of their RNA genome. But ribavirin adds so many extra mutations to the virus during the replication of its genetic materials, it induces a flood of mutations and thus pushes the virus into a kind of genetic meltdown.</p>

            <p><strong>[2.1]</strong> Influenza virus is a class Vb virus, which means that it has a single (–)-stranded RNA for its genome. Which of the following best describes the immediate fate of this (–)-RNA when the virus enters the host cell?</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>It is used directly to encode viral proteins.</li>
                <li>It is used as a template to synthesize a (+)-strand viral messenger RNA (mRNA).</li>
                <li>It is used as a template to synthesize viral DNA.</li>
                <li>It is converted to a provirus.</li>
                <li>It is integrated into the host cell genome.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer: B.</strong> Class Vb viruses, since they have a minus single-stranded RNA genome, cannot use their genomic RNA directly to encode viral proteins. It is used to synthesize a (+)-stranded viral mRNA that is then used to encode the viral proteins. The influenza virus does this by the following mechanism: a virus-specific polymerase first cleaves an oligonucleotide from a host cell mRNA. It uses this as a primer that is elongated by the polymerase to synthesize the viral (+)-mRNA using the (−)-viral RNA genome as the template.</p>

        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer: D.</strong> Xeroderma pigmentosum is a genetic disease in which the ability to remove pyrimidine dimers caused by exposure to UV light is impaired. The mechanism used to remove these pyrimidine dimers (also used to repair DNA that has formed adducts with carcinogenic compounds) is excision repair. The enzymes used in this repair mechanism cleave the affected strand on either side of damaged nucleotides. The oligonucleotide containing the damaged nucleotides is removed and the gap is filled in by DNA polymerase and DNA ligase.</p>

        <h2>Case 3: Methotrexate and Folate Metabolism</h2>
        <p>A 32-year-old female is being treated with methotrexate for a recently diagnosed choriocarcinoma of the ovary, and presents with complaints of oral mucosal ulcers. The patient recalls being advised not to take folate-containing vitamins during therapy. An uncomplicated surgical exploration was performed 5 weeks ago with removal of the affected ovary. The patient has been taking methotrexate for 2 weeks and has never had any of the above symptoms before. On examination, patient was afebrile and appeared ill. Several mucosal ulcers were seen in her mouth. The patient also had some upper abdominal tenderness. Her platelet count is decreased at 60,000/mm<sup>3</sup> (normal 150,000 to 450,000/mm<sup>3</sup>).</p>
        
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>◆ What is the most likely etiology of her symptoms?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>◆ What is the biochemical explanation of her symptoms?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>◆ What part of the cell cycle does methotrexate act on?</strong></p>

        <h3>Answers to Case 3: Methotrexate and Folate Metabolism</h3>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 32-year-old female has oral ulcerations and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) after beginning methotrexate initiated for recently diagnosed ovarian cancer. She recalls being instructed to avoid folate during therapy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Likely cause of her symptoms:</strong> Side effects of methotrexate (antimetabolite chemotherapy) affecting rapidly dividing cells such as oral mucosa.</li>
            <li><strong>Biochemical explanation of her symptoms:</strong> Related to effects of methotrexate on cell cycle of all cells (particularly rapidly dividing cells). Folate antagonists inhibit dihydrofolate reductase (tetrahydrofolate needed for purine synthesis).</li>
            <li><strong>Cell cycle affected by methotrexate:</strong> Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis (S) phase.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>Chemotherapeutic agents are used to treat various types of cancers. Although some are specific for cancer cells, most chemotherapeutic agents are toxic for both normal and cancer cells. Methotrexate acts as a folate antagonist, affecting DNA synthesis. Because cancer cells divide faster than normal cells, a higher proportion of these neoplastic cells will die. Nevertheless, normal cells that also are rapidly dividing, such as the gastrointestinal mucosa, the oral mucosa, and the bone marrow cells, may be affected. The patient was advised to avoid folate during therapy, since folate would be an “antidote,” and would allow the cancer cells to escape cell kill.</p>
        
        <h3>Approach to the Cell Cycle</h3>
        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Understand the components of the cell cycle.</li>
            <li>Know how folate is involved in DNA synthesis.</li>
            <li>Be familiar with the terminology of nucleoside and nucleotide.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Definitions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cell cycle:</strong> The time interval between cell divisions in proliferating cells. The cell cycle is divided into four phases: M phase, in which mitosis takes place; G1 phase, prior to synthesis of DNA; S phase, in which DNA and histones are synthesized to duplicate the chromosomes; and G2 phase, during which there is cell growth and synthesis of macromolecules. Under certain conditions, the cell can enter a quiescent, or G0 phase, which is not part of the regular cell cycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR):</strong> The enzyme required to convert folic acid to its active form, tetrahydrofolate. It requires the cofactor NADPH as a source of reducing equivalents to reduce folate first to DHFR and then to tetrahydrofolate.</li>
            <li><strong>Methotrexate:</strong> A drug that has a similar structure to DHFR. It binds to DHFR reductase and competitively inhibits it, thus decreasing the levels of tetrahydrofolate in the cells. It effectively stops DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells such as cancer cells.</li>
            <li><strong>Tetrahydrofolate (THF):</strong> The active form of the vitamin folic acid. THF is one of the major carriers of one-carbon units at various oxidation states for biosynthetic reactions. It is required for the synthesis of the nucleotide thymidylate (dTMP). Although bacteria can synthesize folic acid, eukaryotes must obtain folate from the diet. Dietary sources of folate include leafy green vegetables (e.g., spinach and turnip greens), citrus fruits, and legumes. Many breakfast cereals, breads, and other grain products are fortified with folate.</li>
            <li><strong>DNA:</strong> Two large molecules composed of deoxynucleotides attached by hydrogen bonds in a helical, antiparallel relationship.</li>
            <li><strong>Nucleosides:</strong> Nitrogenous base plus a sugar (bases in DNA are adenine [A], thymine [T], cytosine [C], and guanine [G]; bases in RNA are A, C, G, but uracil [U] instead of T; sugar moiety in DNA is deoxyribose, and in RNA is ribose).</li>
            <li><strong>Nucleotide:</strong> Nucleoside plus phosphate group.</li>
            <li><strong>Deoxythymidylate (dTMP):</strong> DNA nucleotide consisting of the deoxyribose sugar, thymidine as nitrogenous base, and one phosphate.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Discussion</h4>
        <p>The cell cycle is defined as the time interval between cell divisions in proliferating cells. It is important to note that the cell cycle is not a simple “clock.” Movement through the cell cycle is controlled by a variety of proteins that allow the cell to respond to various stimuli. The eukaryote cell cycle is composed of the following four phases (Figure 3-1):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>M phase—mitosis</li>
            <li>G1 phase (gap 1)—between mitosis and initiation of DNA synthesis</li>
            <li>S phase—when DNA synthesis occurs</li>
            <li>G2 phase (gap 2)—cell growth and macromolecule synthesis</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Although there is great variation in the length of the mammalian cell cycle (hours to days), as a generalization, mammalian cells divide once every 24 hours. The M and S phases of the cell cycle are relatively constant. Therefore, the length of the mammalian cell cycle is determined by length of the G1 and G2 phases. Cell division occurs during M phase, and the mitotic interphase is composed of (G1 + S + G2). M phase, or mitosis, is divided into four subphases, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. In prophase, the nuclear membrane breaks down while the replicated chromosomes condense and are released into the cytoplasm. The chromosomes become aligned on the equatorial plate of the cell during metaphase, and they move from the equatorial plate to the poles during anaphase. The final step in M phase, telophase, is reformation of the nuclear membrane around the chromosomes followed by cytokinesis, or formation of two daughter cells. During the G1 phase, the cell “monitors” itself and its environment. The cell is metabolically active and undergoes continuous growth, but no DNA synthesis occurs during this phase. During G1 the cell makes a “decision” either to continue in the cell cycle and divide or to “withdraw” from the cell cycle and differentiate. The synthesis of DNA and histones to form two sets of chromosomes occurs during S phase. The key event of the G2 phase is for the cell to “make sure that its entire DNA has replicated.” Continued cell growth and the synthesis of cellular macromolecules also occur during the G2 phase, preparing for cell division.</p>
        <p>Under certain conditions cells can leave G1 and enter into the G0 phase of the cell cycle. This phase is not part of the regular cell cycle and represents a specialized state, which can be temporary or permanent. Entry into the G0 phase can be triggered by growth factor withdrawal, negative growth factors, or limited protein synthesis. The cells in G0 are in a nonproliferative or quiescent state, which can vary tremendously in length. Some cells differentiate and never divide again. Others can resume proliferation to replace lost cells as a result of injury or cell death. An important point is that cancer cells do not generally have a G0 phase.</p>
        <p>Key regulatory proteins that govern the cell cycle are the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are serine/threonine protein kinases, and the cyclins, which are regulatory proteins that bind to the CDKs. Proteins that inhibit the kinase activity (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, or CDIs) are also present in the cell. The CDKs are regulated by the levels of cyclins and the CDK/cyclin complex phosphorylates proteins on serine or threonine residues. The cyclins bind to and activate CDKs via protein–protein interactions. Cyclins act as regulatory subunits controlling activity and specificity of the CDK activity. These cyclins can themselves be phosphorylated and dephosphorylated. Cyclin accumulation and degradation controls normal cell cycle activity. For example, the degradation of specific cyclins by proteolysis at the metaphase-anaphase transition ends mitosis.</p>
        <p>Tetrahydrofolate (THF) is the major source of 1-carbon units used in the biosynthesis of many important biological molecules. This cofactor is derived from the vitamin folic acid and is a carrier of activated 1-carbon units at various oxidation levels (methyl, methylene, formyl, formimino, and methenyl). These compounds can be interconverted as required by the cellular process. The major donor of the 1-carbon unit is serine in the following reaction:</p>
        <p>Serine + THF → Glycine + N<sup>5</sup>,N<sup>10</sup>-methylene-THF</p>
        <p>All cells, especially rapidly growing cells, must synthesize thymidylate (dTMP) for DNA synthesis. The difference between (T) and (U) is one methyl group at the carbon-5 position. Thymidylate is synthesized by the methylation of uridylate (dUMP) in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme thymidylate synthase. This reaction requires a methyl donor and a source of reducing equivalents, which are both provided by N<sup>5</sup>,N<sup>10</sup>-methylene THF (Figure 3-2). For this reaction to continue, the regeneration of THF from dihydrofolate (DHF) must occur.</p>
        <p>DHF + NADPH + H<sup>+</sup> → THF + NADP<sup>+</sup></p>
        <p>The enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) catalyzes this reaction, which is a target of the anticancer drugs aminopterin and methotrexate. These drugs are analogs of DHF and act as competitive inhibitors of DHFR.</p>

        <p>Inhibition of this enzyme prevents the regeneration of THF and blocks dTMP synthesis because of the lack of the methyl donor required for the reaction of thymidylate synthase.</p>
        <p>THF is also required as a donor of two carbon atoms in the synthesis of the purine ring structure required for adenine and guanine. The carbon atoms donated by THF are indicated in Figure 3-3. Therefore, a lack of THF blocks the synthesis of the purine ring structure because of the lack of the ability of the cell to synthesize N<sup>10</sup>-formyl-THF.</p>
        <p>In summary, DNA synthesis requires synthesis of dTMP and the purines adenine and guanine. THF, derived from the vitamin folic acid, is required for the biosynthesis of these nucleotides. Treatment with methotrexate blocks the cell’s ability to regenerate THF, leading to inhibition of these biosynthetic pathways. The lack of nucleotides prevents DNA synthesis, and these cancer cells cannot divide without DNA synthesis. Unfortunately, the effects of methotrexate are nonspecific and other rapidly dividing cells such as epithelial cells in the oral cavity, intestine, skin, and blood cells are also inhibited. This leads to the side effects associated with methotrexate (and other cancer chemotherapy drugs) such as mouth sores, low white blood cell counts, stomach upset, hair loss, skin rashes, and itching.</p>

        <h4>Comprehension Questions</h4>
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>[3.1]</strong> A 44-year-old woman who recently lost her job because of absenteeism, presents to her physician complaining of loss of appetite, fatigue, muscle weakness, and emotional depression. The physical examination reveals a somewhat enlarged liver that feels firm and nodular, and there is a hint of jaundice in the sclerae and a hint of alcohol on her breath. The initial laboratory profile included a hematological analysis that showed that she had an anemia with enlarged red blood cells (macrocytic). A bone marrow aspirate confirmed the suspicion that she has a megaloblastic anemia because it showed a greater than normal number of red and white blood cell precursors, most of which were larger than normal. Further analyses revealed that her serum folic acid level was 2.9 ng/mL (normal = 6 to 15), her serum B12 level was 153 pg/mL (normal = 150 to 750), and her serum iron level was normal.</p>
            <p>The patient’s megaloblastic anemia is most likely caused by which of the following?</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>A decreased synthesis of methionine</li>
                <li>A decreased conversion of dUMP to dTMP</li>
                <li>A decrease in the synthesis of phosphatidyl choline</li>
                <li>A decrease in the levels of succinyl CoA</li>
                <li>A decreased synthesis of dUTP</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer: B.</strong> Megaloblastic anemia is caused by a decrease in the synthesis of deoxythymidylate and the purine bases usually caused by a deficiency in either THF or cobalamin or both. This results in decreased DNA synthesis, which results in abnormally large hematopoietic cells created by perturbed cell division and DNA replication and repair. This patient exhibits signs of chronic alcoholism, which often leads to a folate deficiency. This can occur due to poor dietary intake, decreased absorption of folate due to damage of the intestinal brush border cells and resulting conjugase deficiency, and poor renal resorption of folate.</p>
        
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>[3.2]</strong> A patient presents with a urinary tract infection and is prescribed a combination drug containing trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. These drugs are effective because they do which of the following?</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Bind to operons to prevent synthesis of bacterial mRNA</li>
                <li>Block transport across bacterial cell walls</li>
                <li>Inhibit bacterial synthesis of cobalamin (B12)</li>
                <li>Inhibit bacterial synthesis of THF</li>
                <li>Inhibit synthesis of phospholipids in bacteria</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer: D.</strong> Bacteria must synthesize the folate that is required for their biosynthetic processes; they do not have a transporter to bring folate into the cell. Trimethoprim inhibits prokaryotic DHFR (eukaryotic is not affected) and sulfamethoxazole is an analog of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a precursor to folic acid. Bacteria will use this analog instead of PABA and produce a nonfunctional folate.</p>
        
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>[3.3]</strong> Methotrexate is often used as a chemotherapeutic agent to treat patients with leukemia. This drug is effective because it inhibits cells in which part of the cell cycle?</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>G1 phase</li>
                <li>S phase</li>
                <li>M phase</li>
                <li>G2 phase</li>
                <li>G0 phase</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer: B.</strong> Methotrexate inhibits the synthesis of deoxythymidine by preventing the regeneration of THF by inhibiting the enzyme DHFR. Inhibiting the synthesis of deoxythymidylate prevents the cell from synthesizing its DNA. DNA synthesis occurs exclusively during S phase of the cell cycle.</p>
        
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>[3.4]</strong> Leukemia patients are often given the compound Leucovorin (N<sup>5</sup>-formyl THF) following treatment with the drug methotrexate. Why is Leucovorin useful as part of this treatment protocol?</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>It facilitates the uptake of methotrexate by cells</li>
                <li>It can be converted to THF by bypassing DHFR</li>
                <li>It acts as an activator of thymidylate synthase</li>
                <li>It prevents the uptake of methotrexate by normal cells</li>
                <li>It stimulates cells of the immune system</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer: B.</strong> Leucovorin (N<sup>5</sup>-formyl THF, folinic acid) is used as an antidote for cells that have decreased levels of folic acid. Treatment of leukemia patients with methotrexate kills the tumor cells but also other normal rapidly dividing cells. N<sup>5</sup>-formyl THF is normally administered 24 hours following treatment with methotrexate; it can be converted to THF by these normal cells by bypassing the block caused by methotrexate. Therefore, these normal cells can synthesize deoxythymidine and carry out DNA synthesis.</p>

        <h2>Case 4: Folic Acid Deficiency</h2>
        <p>A 47-year-old female is brought to the emergency department with complaints of malaise, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue. The patient reveals a long history of alcohol abuse for the last 10 years requiring drinks daily especially in the morning as an “eye opener.” She has been to rehab on several occasions for alcoholism but has not been able to stop drinking. She is currently homeless and jobless. She denies cough, fever, chills, upper respiratory symptoms, sick contacts, recent travel, hematemesis, or abdominal pain. She reports feeling hungry and has not eaten very well in a long time. On physical exam she appears malnourished but in no distress. Her physical exam is normal. Her blood count reveals a normal white blood cell count but does show an anemia with large red blood cells. Her amylase, lipase, and liver function tests were normal.</p>
        
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>◆ What is the most likely cause of her anemia?</strong></p>

        <h3>Answers to Case 4: Folic Acid Deficiency</h3>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 47-year-old alcoholic white female has fatigue, malaise, nausea, vomiting, and poor nutritional intake with macrocytic anemia and no evidence of pancreatitis, liver disease, or peptic ulcer disease.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cause of anemia:</strong> Folic acid deficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Molecular basis of macrocytosis:</strong> Abnormal proliferation of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, since folate deficiency encumbers the maturation of these cells by inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>Folate is an essential vitamin, found in green leafy vegetables. It is essential for many biochemical processes in the body, including DNA synthesis and red blood cell synthesis. Recently, folate supplementation has been found to be important in the prevention of fetal neural tube defects such as anencephaly (absence of brain cerebral cortex and no skull or skin covering the brain), and spina bifida (spinal cord malformation whereby the meninges are exposed leading to neurologic deficits). Alcoholics in particular are at risk for folate deficiency because of impaired gastrointestinal absorption and poor nutrition. Macrocytic anemia (large red blood cells) may be seen with folate deficiency. Treatment consists for folic acid replacement (usually 1 mg/day) by mouth with correction of anemia over the following 1 to 2 months. The diet usually requires adjustment, and correctable causes addressed (malnutrition in this case). Notably, folate deficiency in pregnancy has been associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) in fetuses. It is recommended that mothers take at least 400 μg of folic acid 3 months prior to conception to reduce the risk of NTD. At times, more than 400 μg of folic acid per day is recommended prior to conception. Some specific examples include a history of previous NTD, sickle cell disease, multiple gestations, and Crohn disease.</p>

        </ul>
        
        <h4>Discussion</h4>
        <p>Folate (folic acid) is an essential vitamin which, in its active form of tetrahydrofolate (THF, Figure 4-1), transfers 1-carbon groups to intermediates in metabolism. Folate plays an important role in DNA synthesis. It is required for the de novo synthesis of purines and for the conversion of deoxyuridine 5-monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine 5′-monophosphate (dTMP). Additionally, folate derivatives participate in the biosynthesis of choline, serine, glycine, and methionine. However, in situations of folate deficiency, symptoms are not observed from the lack of these products as adequate levels of choline and amino acids are obtained from the diet.</p>
        <p>Folate deficiency results in megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia is characterized by macrocytic erythrocytes produced by abnormal proliferation of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow. Folate deficiency encumbers the maturation of these cells by inhibition of DNA synthesis. Without an adequate supply of folate, DNA synthesis is limited by decreased purine and dTMP levels.</p>
        <p>Folate exists in a pool of interconvertible intermediates each carrying a 1-carbon fragment in several different oxidation states (Figure 4-2). The total body stores of folate is approximately 110 mg/70 kg and approximately 420 μg/70 kg is lost each day via the urine and feces. Two different forms of folate are required for different aspects of nucleotide biosynthesis. N<sup>10</sup>-formyl THF provides the C-2 and C-8 carbons for the de novo synthesis of purine rings, and thus is critical for DNA metabolism.</p>
        <p>The methylene form, N<sup>5</sup>,N<sup>10</sup>-methylene THF, is required for the production of dTMP from dUMP. This reaction involves the transfer of a CH2 group and a hydrogen from N<sup>5</sup>,N<sup>10</sup>-methylene THF. In this process, THF is oxidized to dihydrofolate (DHF). For subsequent dTMP production, THF must be regenerated. THF is produced from DHF by the enzyme DHF reductase (DHFR) in a reaction requiring NADPH. DHFR is the target of methotrexate, an antifolate cancer chemotherapeutic, which by limiting the available pool of N<sup>5</sup>,N<sup>10</sup>-methylene THF, inhibits DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cancer cells. Methotrexate therapy can produce side effects resembling folate deficiency. Additionally, bacterial DHFR is a target for antimicrobials.</p>
        <p>Outside of DNA synthesis, folate plays a role in methylation metabolism. The major methyl donor is S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), which is required for many reactions. For example, SAM is needed for the production of norepinephrine from epinephrine and for DNA methylation, which can influence gene transcription. After methyl group transfer, SAM is converted to S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH), which is hydrolyzed to homocysteine and adenosine. To restore the levels of methionine (an essential amino acid), homocysteine must be methylated (Figure 4-3). This reaction is dependent on N<sup>5</sup>-methyl THF and vitamin B12. Methionine levels can be limiting, making the availability of N<sup>5</sup>-methyl THF for conversion of homocysteine to methionine critical. Further, in the absence of B12, THF can be trapped in the N<sup>5</sup>-methyl THF form and thus be removed from the THF pool. This is referred to as the “methyl trap,” which can impact other areas of 1-carbon metabolism, such as dTMP production.</p>

        <p>Folate deficiency perturbs DNA metabolism and methylation reactions. Leafy green vegetables are good sources of folate; however, folate is labile and may be damaged during food preparation. Another dietary source of folate is cereal products, especially breads and breakfast cereals that have been fortified with folic acid. Folate is also produced within the gut lumen by certain intestinal bacteria; however, the amount of folate absorbed from this source is minor in humans. In its simplest form, folate consists of three connected chemical moieties: a pteridine ring (6-methylpterin), p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), and glutamate. In nature, folate is generally polyglutamated (decorated by two to seven additional glutamic acid residues). Conjugases (γ-glutamyl carboxypeptidases) in the intestinal lumen cleave off extra glutamic acid residues, and folate is absorbed by the mucosa of the small intestine (Figure 4-4).</p>
        <p>In cases of chronic alcoholism, folate deficiency may result from poor nutrition or from poor absorption of folate secondary to a conjugase deficiency. Once folate deficiency occurs, abnormal megaloblastic replication of epithelial mucosa can occur, which further impairs folate uptake.</p>
        <p>After absorption, folate is reduced to THF by dihydrofolate reductase. The majority of circulating folate is in the form of N<sup>5</sup>-methyl THF. Cells use specific transporters for THF uptake, and cellular machinery polyglutamates the folate to aid in cellular retention.</p>
        
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x200?text=Figure+4-4.+Intestinal+absorption+of+folates" alt="Intestinal absorption of folates">
        <p class="figure-caption">Figure 4-4. Intestinal absorption of dietary folates (THF-[Glu]<sub>n</sub>) and folic acid (F) from fortified cereal products and vitamin supplements. In the duodenum and upper jejunum, extra glutamate residues are cleaved by conjugases (γ-glutamyl carboxypeptidases). Folate (F) and reduced folate (THF) are absorbed by a proton-coupled, high affinity folate transporter into the mucosal cell, converted to N<sup>5</sup>-methyl THF and exported into the portal circulation. N<sup>5</sup>-methyl THF is taken up into cells by facilitative diffusion, converted to THF by the B12-requiring methionine synthase and then converted to a polyglutamate.</p>
        
        <p>In summary, folate is a vitamin acquired from the diet that is essential for 1-carbon metabolism. Inadequate folate levels inhibit DNA synthesis by limiting purine nucleotide and dTMP levels, which results in the abnormal cellular proliferation observed in megaloblastic anemia. Folate is also required to replenish the methionine pool for SAM-dependent methylation reactions.</p>
        
        <h4>Comprehension Questions</h4>
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>[4.1]</strong> Because of the close interrelationship between the vitamins, patients with deficiencies of either folate or vitamin B12 exhibit similar symptoms. Which of the following tests would best help distinguish between a folate and vitamin B12 deficiency?</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Activity of methionine synthase</li>
                <li>Blood level of cystathionine</li>
                <li>Blood level of homocysteine</li>
                <li>Blood level of methionine</li>
                <li>Blood level of methylmalonate</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer: E.</strong> Vitamin B12 is a cofactor in two biochemical reactions, the conversion of homocysteine to methionine by the enzyme methionine synthase and the conversion of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. N<sup>5</sup>-methyl THF is a methyl donor in the methionine synthase reaction. A folate deficiency would result in decreased methionine synthase activity and decreases in methionine and cystathionine concentrations, while homocysteine levels would be increased. A vitamin B12 deficiency would also yield these same results, but in addition methylmalonate levels would increase as a consequence of a decrease in the activity of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity.</p>
        
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>[4.2]</strong> A muscular 25-year-old male presents with dermatitis and an inflamed tongue. A history reveals that he has been consuming raw eggs as part of his training regimen for the past 6 months.</p>
            <p><strong>[4.3]</strong> A 30-year-old male goes to his dentist complaining of loosening teeth. Examination also reveals his gums are swollen, purple, and spongy. The dentist also notes that the patient’s fingers have multiple splinter hemorrhages near the distal ends of the nail and that a wound on the patient’s forearm has failed to heal properly.</p>

            <p>For each patient, select the vitamin that is most likely to be deficient from the following list:</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Ascorbic acid (vitamin C)</li>
                <li>Biotin</li>
                <li>Cobalamin (vitamin B12)</li>
                <li>Folic acid</li>
                <li>Niacin (vitamin B3)</li>
                <li>Pantothenic acid</li>
                <li>Riboflavin (vitamin B2)</li>
                <li>Thiamine (vitamin B1)</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer [4.2]: B.</strong> Raw eggs contain a protein, avidin, which binds biotin strongly. Because native avidin is resistant to hydrolysis by digestive proteases, when it binds biotin it prevents its absorption. Avidin that has been denatured by cooking will be broken down during the digestive process. A biotin deficiency manifests itself as an erythematous, scaly skin eruption and can also cause hair loss and conjunctivitis. A biotin deficiency can also occur following prolonged total parenteral nutrition if biotin is not supplemented.</p>
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer [4.3]: A.</strong> The patient exhibits the classic symptoms of scurvy, a deficiency in vitamin C. In addition to being an important biological antioxidant, ascorbic acid is required for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues of procollagen in the synthesis of collagen. A deficiency leads to defects in collagen synthesis, which adversely affects the intercellular cement substances in connective tissue, bones, and dentin.</p>
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer [4.4]: D.</strong> The fetus needs a constant supply of cofactors for normal development. Folic acid supplements of 400 μg/day prior to conception have been shown to decrease the incidence of neural tube defects such as spina bifida.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition affecting approximately 1 in 2500 white individuals. Affected patients usually have abnormal mucus secretion and eccrine sweat glands leading to respiratory infections, gastrointestinal obstruction, pancreatic enzyme dysfunction leading to malabsorption of nutrients, and excessive electrolyte secretion. The protein cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is defective, leading to abnormal chloride transport. Approximately 70 percent of mutations are accounted for by deletion of three specific base pairs at the F508 position of the CFTR. Oligonucleotide probes can be used to assay for this mutation, but other tests are required for the less common mutations.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disease affecting the Caucasian population. It has a frequency of approximately 1 in 2500 and a carrier frequency of approximately 1 in 25. The protein affected is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is a chloride ion channel. There are over 1000 mutations that have been discovered in the CFTR gene and over 80 percent of these mutations lead to disease. The mutations lead to (1) defective or decreased protein production, (2) defective processing of the protein, (3) protein that is defective in the regulation of the chloride channel, or (4) defect in the transport of chloride ions. The most common mutation, a deletion of a phenylalanine residue at amino acid position 508 (ΔF508), results in misfolding of the protein; it consequently does not traffic to the membrane.</p>
        <p>Defects in the CFTR decrease the ability of cells to transport Cl− in a number of tissues, particularly the pancreas, airway epithelia, and sweat glands. When Cl− transport is defective in the pancreas, it leads to decreased HCO3− secretion and decreased hydration that leads to thick secretions that block the pancreatic ducts and destruction of the organ. In the lungs, the decreased absorption of Cl− ions is thought to increase the absorption of the airway surface liquid thus increasing the viscosity of mucous, decreasing mucociliary clearance and increasing the incidence of airway infections. In sweat glands, defects in CFTR prevent the reabsorption of Cl− in the sweat gland duct, thus increasing the concentration of NaCl in sweat. The presence of salty sweat in children with CF gives rise to the Northern Europe adage: “Woe to that child which when kissed on the forehead tastes salty. He is bewitched and soon must die.”</p>
        <p>Gel electrophoresis is a method routinely used in biochemistry and molecular biology to separate, identify, and purify peptides, proteins, and DNA fragments based on their size. Electrophoresis is a method by which charged molecules in a solution are separated in an electric field because of their different mobilities. The mobility of an ion in the electric field is dependent on the charge of the ionized molecule, the voltage gradient of the electric field, and the frictional resistance of the supporting medium. The supporting medium of choice for most protein and peptide analyses, as well as small DNA fragments, is polyacrylamide gel. For large DNA fragments, agarose gel gives the best results.</p>
        <p>In general, DNA molecules have a high negative charge-to-mass ratio owing to their sugar-phosphate backbone. Therefore, when an electric field is applied, DNA will migrate through the agarose (or polyacrylamide) gel toward the positive pole in the electrophoresis apparatus. Because of the high charge-to-mass ratio, the relative electrophoretic mobility of DNA depends primarily on the size of the DNA molecule and porosity of the gel matrix, which can be varied by the concentration of agarose or polyacrylamide in the gel. Small DNA strands will move fast, whereas large fragments will lag behind smaller fragments as the DNA migrates through the gel. To estimate the size of DNA in the samples, molecular weight markers (a mixture of DNA fragments of known molecular size) are applied to one of the lanes in the gel.</p>
        <p>Gel electrophoresis separates DNA molecules based on their frictional coefficient, which is dependent on the length and conformation of the fragment. For most linear double-stranded DNA molecules, separation will be according to their molecular weight. However, circular DNA molecules (e.g., from bacteria or plasmids) can adopt a supercoiled structure and therefore will pass through the gel with less resistance than the rod shape of linear DNA.</p>
        <p>Gel electrophoresis can be applied as a method for detection of genetic diseases such as Cystic fibrosis (CF). Larger deletions in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene will cause it to move differently than the full-length wild type gene. In most cases, the DNA sample of the patient is amplified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers. After the electrophoresis of the PCR samples, the bands are visualized under ultraviolet (UV) light using ethidium bromide staining.</p>
        <p>Bands of molecules separated by electrophoresis can be detected in the gel by various staining and destaining methods, such as the above-mentioned ethidium bromide. However, more specific information can be obtained by application of blotting techniques. There are three different blotting techniques based on whether DNA, RNA, or protein is being analyzed. However, all blotting techniques have major steps in common. These include (1) the isolation of the biomolecules of interest (DNA, RNA, or protein); (2) separation of the mixture using gel electrophoresis; and (3) subsequent transfer of the sample molecules from the gel to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane. The final identification step involves incubation of the membrane blot with probes that bind specifically to the molecule of interest. DNA is analyzed using Southern blotting, named after E. M. Southern, who first described this procedure in 1975. Based on this initial terminology, Northern and Western blotting were given as names referring to RNA and protein-blotting transfer, respectively. The major difference between the procedures involves the probes used for detection and identification of the molecules of interest. Southern and Northern blots take advantage of the ability of complementary nucleic acid strands to hybridize.</p>
        <p>In a Southern blot, after the DNA fragments have been transferred from the electrophoretic gel to the membrane, they are allowed to interact with a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide that contains the sequence of nucleic acids in the gene of interest. The oligonucleotide probe is usually radioactively labeled, which allows the DNA band to be identified following exposure to x-ray film. Northern blots are used to monitor the expression of a gene of interest by determining the amount of mRNA present. Then the mRNA is isolated, separated by electrophoresis, and, after transfer to a membrane, is allowed to interact with a radioactive DNA polynucleotide that has a sequence of the gene of interest. Visualization is by exposure to x-ray film.</p>
        <p>In the case of a Western blot of a protein mixture, after the proteins have been transferred to the membrane, the membrane is probed with an antibody that binds specifically to the target protein/antigen. The antibody may be radioactive or coupled to a fluorescent chromophore to allow easy detection.</p>
        <p>The ability to sequence DNA and analyze genes at the nucleotide level has become a powerful tool in many areas of analysis and research. The Sanger dideoxynucleotide method of DNA sequencing was first developed in 1975 by Frederick Sanger, after whom the technique was named. The strategy used in this method is to create four sets of labeled fragments, corresponding to the four deoxyribonucleotides. It involves the enzymatic duplication of a DNA strand that is complementary to the strand of interest. In the Sanger method, 2′,3′-dideoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs) are used in addition to deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). Since the ddNTPs lack the 3′-OH group, they will terminate DNA chain elongation because they cannot form a phosphodiester bond with the next dNTP. Each of the four sequencing reaction tubes (A, C, G, and T) would then contain a single-stranded DNA template; a primer sequence; DNA polymerase to initiate synthesis where primer is hybridized to the template; mixture of the four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP) to extend the DNA strand; one labeled dNTP (using a radioactive element or dye); and one ddNTP, which terminates the growing chain wherever it is incorporated. Tube A would have ddATP, tube C ddCTP, and so forth. Since the concentration of the ddNTP is low (approximately 1 percent of dNTP), the chain will terminate randomly at various positions throughout the chain, thus yielding an array of different length DNA fragments each terminated with the particular dideoxyribonucleotide. The fragments of varying length are then separated by electrophoresis in parallel lanes (each corresponding to the four deoxyribonucleotides) and the positions of the fragments analyzed to determine the sequence. The fragments are separated on the basis of size, with the shorter fragments moving faster and appearing at the bottom of the gel. The sequence is then read from bottom to the top, yielding the 5′ to 3′ sequence.</p>
        <p>The ability to rapidly sequence DNA has become an important tool for molecular biology. For example, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method needs the information of the sequence flanking the region of interest to be able to design specific oligonucleotides (primers) to amplify the specific DNA region. Another important use is identifying restriction sites in plasmids, which is useful in cloning a foreign gene into the plasmid. Before DNA sequencing, molecular biologists had to sequence proteins directly, which was a challenging and laborious process. Now amino acid sequences can be determined more easily by sequencing a piece of cDNA and finding an open reading frame. In eukaryotic gene expression, sequencing made it possible to identify conserved sequence motifs and determine important sites in the promoter regions. Furthermore, sequencing can be used to identify the site of a point mutation or other changes in the genome.</p>
        <p>Recombinant DNA technology allows for a transfer of a DNA fragment of interest into a self-replicating genetic element such as a bacterial plasmid or virus. This technology has allowed many human genes to be cloned in Escherichia coli, yeast, or even mammalian cells, leading to easy production of human recombinant proteins in vitro. These include insulin for diabetics, factor VIII for males suffering from hemophilia A, human growth hormone (GH), erythropoietin (EPO) for treating anemia, three types of interferons, several interleukins, adenosine deaminase (ADA) for treating some forms of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), angiostatin and endostatin for trials as anticancer drugs, and parathyroid hormone with many more in development.</p>
        <p>Efforts toward gene therapy make use of recombinant DNA technology. In the case of CF, which is the result of a defect in a single gene, direct insertion of the normal gene should theoretically restore the function of CFTR in the treated cells of the CF patient. Since respiratory failure is the major cause of deaths (95 percent) in CF, lung cells have become the primary target for efforts at treating CF with gene therapy. Another advantage is the ability of delivering vectors containing the functional CFTR gene directly into the patient’s airways by aerosol, without causing trauma to any other part of the body. To date, CF trials rely on adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), and cationic liposomes to mediate gene transfer to nasal epithelial cells and respiratory epithelial cells. Adenoviruses do not integrate into the host chromosome; therefore, the vectors derived from these viruses have the advantage of negligible oncogenic potential. The disadvantages are the development of inflammation and the transient expression of the recombinant genes. Adeno-associated viruses are unique among animal viruses, because they require coinfection with an unrelated helper virus (either adenovirus or herpesvirus) for productive infection in cell culture. However, AAV has the ability to integrate into the host genome in the absence of a helper virus, but because it integrates at a specific location, the risk of virus-induced mutagenesis and oncogenesis is reduced. Liposomes, however, are synthetic lipid bilayers forming spherical vesicles, with size ranging from 25 nm to 1 mm in diameter depending on how they are made. Liposomes can transfect a variety of cell types, are biodegradable and hypoimmunogenic, and can be manufactured to a drug standard. Theoretically, there is no restriction on the size of the DNA to be delivered by liposome. The disadvantages are short-term expression of the transferred gene, no specific targeting ability, and a low transfection rate in vivo.</p>

        <h2>Case 9: Erythromycin and Lyme Disease</h2>
        <p>A 40-year-old male returned from a deer-hunting trip approximately 6 weeks ago, and presents to clinic with multiple complaints. He states that recently he has had worsening joint pain and “arthritis” in multiple joints that seems to move to different spots. Patient also complains of some numbness in his feet bilaterally. The patient denies any medical problems and he had a normal annual physical prior to hunting trip. On further questioning, he remembered having a rash on his body and the lesions were circular and appeared to be resolving in the center. He noted that he felt really bad once he got home with muscle ache (myalgias), joint ache (arthralgias), stiff neck, and severe headache. He also remembered that many of his hunting friends had experienced flea and tick bites and is quite sure he was bitten as well. The physical exam is essentially normal except some joint tenderness of left knee and right shoulder. After making your diagnosis you gave him a prescription for erythromycin.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>Lyme disease is a multisystem disease caused by the spirochete (spiral-shaped bacteria), Borrelia burgdorferi, nearly always transmitted by tick bite. Lyme disease is much more common in the New England area, usually during the late spring and early summer months. The deer tick is the main vector of transmission. The first stage is an acute infection with a red papule developing at the site of the bite, sometimes with lymphadenopathy and fever. The second stage includes disseminated infection and can lead to involvement of the heart, brain, joints, and skin. The typical target-shaped skin lesions may be seen. The third stage is a chronic infection and may last for years. Antibiotics are the treatment of choice, usually tetracyclines or penicillins.</p>

        <h4>Definitions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A-site:</strong> The acceptor site on the ribosome into which an aminoacyl-charged transfer RNA (tRNA) is brought that has an anticodon that is complementary to the messenger RNA (mRNA) codon.

            <li><strong>Anticodon:</strong> The three-base sequence on a tRNA that will base pair with the three-base sequence on the mRNA. The anticodon is specific for an amino acid; it translates the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence in the protein produced.</li>

            <li><strong>Nucleolar organizing region (NOR):</strong> Area of the nucleolus where a great deal of rRNA transcription and synthesis occurs.</li>
            <li><strong>P-site:</strong> The peptidyl site on the ribosome to which Met-tRNA is brought to base pair with the mRNA sequence AUG. It is also the site to which the peptidyl RNA is moved in a process known as translocation following the formation of a new peptide bond.</li>
            <li><strong>Posttranscription modification of tRNA:</strong> The synthesis of tRNA involves modification of some uridine nucleotides to unusual nucleotides, such as pseudouridine, ribothymidine, and dihydrouridine.</li>
            <li><strong>Ribosomes:</strong> Complexes of proteins and rRNA on which protein synthesis occurs. There are two major subunits to all ribosomes, a larger subunit (50S for prokaryotes, 60S for eukaryotes) and a smaller subunit (30S for prokaryotes, 40S for eukaryotes).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>The synthesis of proteins involves converting the nucleotide sequence of specific regions of DNA into mRNA (transcription) followed by the formation of peptide bonds in a complex set of reactions that occur on ribosomes (translation). The amino acids incorporated into the protein are first activated by being attached to a family of tRNA molecules, each of which recognizes, by complementary base-pairing interactions, particular sets of three nucleotides (codons) in the mRNA. Proteins are synthesized on ribosomes by linking amino acids together in the specific linear order stipulated by the sequence of codons in an mRNA. Ribosomes are compact ribonucleoprotein particles found in the cytosol of all cells. All ribosomes are composed of a small and a large subunit. The two subunits contain rRNAs of different lengths, as well as a different set of proteins. All ribosomes consist of two major rRNA molecules (23S and 16S rRNA in bacteria, 28S and 18S rRNA in eukaryotes) and one or two small RNAs. Small and large subunits are brought together by an mRNA molecule and protein synthesis starts immediately. After the protein is synthesized, the ribosomal subunits separate and are reused.</p>
        <p>Protein synthesis is divided into three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chain initiation:</strong> Initiation requires the smaller ribosomal subunit, an initiation tRNA (with a 5¢-CAU-3¢ anticodon), mRNA with its initiator codon (5¢-AUG-3¢), and several initiation factors, all of which form the ribosomal initiation complex. The initiation complex is near completion when a tRNA carrying the amino acid methionine hydrogen bonds to the AUG codon on the mRNA. When these components are in place, the larger ribosomal subunit joins the complex in such a way that the initiator met-tRNAmet is localized in the P- or peptidyl site. The chain initiation phase ends and a second amino acid can be inserted.</li>
            <li><strong>Chain elongation:</strong> Elongation occurs by bringing an aminoacyl-charged tRNA to the A- or acceptor site, followed by formation of the peptide bond and the translocation of a tRNA from the A- to the P-site. Proteins called elongation factors are the workhorses in the process of elongating the nascent polypeptide chain by one amino acid at a time. Translation elongation factors are involved in the following three-step cycle:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Codon recognition:</strong> A hydrogen bond forms between the mRNA codon and the anticodon of the next aminoacyl tRNA at the empty A-site of the ribosome.</li>
                    <li><strong>Peptide bond formation:</strong> An enzyme called peptidyl transferase embedded in the large ribosomal subunit catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the polypeptide of the peptidyl-tRNA in the P-site and the newly arrived aminoacyl tRNA in the A-site.</li>
                    <li><strong>Translocation:</strong> The tRNA in the P-site is ejected so that the newly formed peptidyl-tRNA located in the A-site can shift over to the P-site freeing up the A-site for the next aminoacyl-charged tRNA.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Chain termination:</strong> Elongation comes to an end when one (or more) of three stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) is encountered. A protein called a release factor binds directly to the termination codon in the A-site. The newly synthesized protein is hydrolyzed from the tRNA and both the tRNA and the protein are released from the ribosome.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A list of key differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes with respect to protein synthesis includes the existence of multiple eukaryotic initiation factors that facilitate the assembly of the ribosomal protein synthetic machinery, whereas there are only three for prokaryotes. An initiation site on bacterial mRNA consists of the AUG initiation codon preceded with a gap of approximately 10 bases by the Shine-Dalgarno polypurine hexamer, whereas the 5′ Cap (a 7-methylguanylate residue in a 5′→5′ triphosphate linkage) acts as an initiation signal in eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, the first or N-terminal amino acid is a formyl-methionine (fMet), but in eukaryotes, it is usually a simple methionine. Additionally, the size and nature of the prokaryotic ribosomes are quite different from the eukaryotic ribosomes.</p>
        <p>Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a component of the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. rRNA molecules are extremely abundant, making up at least 80 percent of the RNA molecules found in a typical eukaryotic cell. Virtually all ribosomal proteins are in contact with rRNA. Most of the contacts between ribosomal subunits are made between the 16S and 23S rRNAs such that the interactions involving rRNA are a key part of ribosome function. The environment of the tRNA-binding sites is largely determined by rRNA. The rRNA molecules have several roles in protein synthesis. 16S rRNA plays an active role in the functions of the 30S subunit. It interacts directly with mRNA, with the 50S subunit, and with the anticodons of tRNAs in the P- and A-sites. Peptidyl transferase activity resides exclusively in the 23S rRNA. Finally, the rRNA molecules have a structural role. They fold into three-dimensional shapes that form the scaffold on which the ribosomal proteins assemble.</p>
        <p>Many antibiotics act to inhibit protein synthesis in prokaryotes without affecting eukaryotic cells much. Several important targets in protein synthesis have been identified that are blocked by these agents to curb microorganism growth. Aminoglycosides interfere with binding of fMet-tRNA to the ribosome, thereby preventing correct initiation of protein synthesis and partially freezing the complex. Puromycin, on the other hand, causes premature termination of protein synthesis because it resembles tyrosyl-tRNA. It can bind to the A-site on the ribosome, and the peptidyl transferase will form a peptide bond between the growing peptide and puromycin. However, since there is no anticodon to bind to the mRNA, the peptidyl-puromycin is released from the ribosome following formation of the peptide bond, thus stopping the synthesis. Tetracyclines inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria by blocking the A-site on the ribosome and inhibiting binding of aminoacyl tRNAs. Macrolides bind to the 50S subunit near the P-site to cause conformational changes and inhibit translocation of the peptidyl tRNA from the A-site to the P-site. Lincosamides bind near the P-site and interfere with binding of the aminoacyl end of the AA-tRNA. They occupy the site or change the ribosomal conformation such that it destabilizes the ribosomes and the growing chains fall off the mRNA. Chloramphenicol inhibits protein synthesis by bacterial ribosomes by blocking peptidyl transfer. It inhibits peptide bond formation between AA-tRNA and the growing chain on the P-site by inhibiting peptidyl transferase. Neomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin interfere with the decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit. This region interacts with the wobble base in the anticodon of tRNA and blocks self-splicing of group I introns. Streptomycin, a basic trisaccharide, causes misreading of the genetic code in bacteria at relatively low concentrations but can inhibit initiation at higher concentrations.</p>
        <p>Macrolide antibiotics constitute a group of 12- to 16-membered lactone rings substituted with one or more sugar residues, some of which may be amino sugars. Macrolides such as erythromycin are generally bacteriostatic, although some of these drugs are bactericidal only at very high concentrations. Gram-positive bacteria accumulate approximately 100 times more erythromycin than do gram-negative microorganisms. Cells are considerably more permeable to the nonionized form of the drug, which explains increased antimicrobial activity observed at alkaline pH. The newer macrolides have structural modifications, such as methylation of the nitrogen atom in the lactone ring, that improve acid stability and tissue penetration of these agents. Macrolides act by binding reversibly to the ribosomal subunits of sensitive microorganisms and thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. Resistance to macrolides in clinical isolates is most frequently a result of posttranscriptional methylation of an adenine residue of 23S ribosomal RNA, which leads to coresistance to macrolides. Other mechanisms of resistance involving cell impermeability or drug inactivation have also been detected. It is believed that erythromycin does not inhibit peptide bond formation directly but rather inhibits the translocation step wherein a newly synthesized peptidyl tRNA molecule moves from the acceptor site on the ribosome to the peptidyl or donor site. Erythromycin, which does not reach the peptidyl transferase center, induces dissociation of peptidyl tRNAs containing six, seven, or eight amino acid residues.</p>

            [9.1] B. Chloramphenicol inhibits protein synthesis by inhibiting peptidyl transferase. This peptidyl group cannot be transferred to the aminoacyl-tRNA in the A-site.<br>
            [9.2] J. Tetracyclines bind to the A-site of the prokaryotic ribosome and prevent aminoacyl-tRNAs from binding. Thus protein synthesis is halted because new amino acids cannot be added to the growing protein.<br>
            [9.3] C. Erythromycin and other macrolide antibiotics bind the 50S subunit near the P-site and cause conformational changes that inhibit the translocation of peptidyl tRNA from the A-site to the P-site.<br>
            [9.4] A. Diphtheria toxin has two subunits. The B subunit binds to a cell surface receptor and facilitates the entry of the A subunit into the cell. The A subunit then catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF2). EF2 is thus inhibited from participating in the translocation process of protein synthesis; hence, protein synthesis stops.<br>
            [9.5] E. An inducer is a small molecule that binds to and inactivates a repressor, which allows the sequence of DNA to be transcribed. An operon is a set of prokaryotic genes in close proximity that are coordinated as “all off” or “all on.” An inducer may act to “turn on” the operon. One classic example is the lac operon. When allolactose is present, it serves as an inducer, and the operon is turned on, allowing proteins to be formed that metabolize lactose.

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is usually an acute infection affecting the fallopian tubes and possibly the uterus and ovaries. It is generally sexually transmitted, caused by organisms such as Chlamydia or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhea). The diagnosis is made clinically based on the typical history and physical examination. A purulent cervical discharge is highly suggestive. Nearly all patients have cervical motion tenderness, that is, pain with motion and palpation of the cervix. The treatment is with antibiotics. Quinolone antibiotics have been popular in the past; however, increasing bacterial resistance, particularly in Southeast Asia and California, has rendered these agents less desirable. Complications of PID include infertility or ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy in the tube) as consequence of tubal damage.</p>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>The quinolones are broad-spectrum synthetic antibiotic drugs that contain the 4-quinolone ring. The first quinolone, nalidixic acid, was synthesized in 1962. More recently, a family of fluoroquinolones has been produced that contain a fluorine substituent at position 6 and a carboxylic acid moiety in the 3 position of the basic ring structure. R1, R7, and X are substituted with different side chains for the purpose of increasing bioavailability of the compound. A typical example of a fluoroquinolone is ciprofloxacin. The quinolone antibiotics target bacterial DNA gyrase in many gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the like.</p>
        <p>The normal biological functioning of DNA-like ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcription and DNA replication occurs only if it is in the proper topological state. In duplex DNA, the two strands are wound about each other once every 10 bp, that is, once every turn of the helix. Double-stranded circular DNA can form either negative supercoils when the strands are underwound or positive supercoils when they are overwound. Negative supercoiling introduces a torsional stress that promotes unwinding or separation of the right-handed B-DNA double helix, while positive supercoiling overwinds such a helix.</p>
        <p>Supercoiling is controlled by a remarkable group of enzymes known as topoisomerases, which alter the topology of the circular DNA but not its covalent structure. There are two classes of topoisomerases. Type I topoisomerases relax DNA from negative supercoils formed by the action of type II topoisomerase by creating transient single-strand breaks in DNA without any expense of ATP. Type II topoisomerases (also called DNA gyrases) change DNA topology by making transient double-strand breaks in DNA and require ATP consumption.</p>
        <p>During DNA replication, type II topoisomerase, or TOPO II, plays an important role in the fork progression by continuous removal of the excessive positive supercoils that stem from the unwinding of the DNA strands. TOPO II has the ability to cut both strands of a double-stranded DNA molecule, pass another portion of the duplex through the cut, and reseal the cut in a process that uses ATP. Hydrolysis of ATP by TOPO II’s inherent ATPase activity powers the conformational changes that are critical for the enzyme’s operation. Based on the DNA substrate, TOPO II can change a positive supercoil into a negative supercoil or increase the number of negative supercoils by two.</p>
        <p>The DNA gyrase of E. coli is composed of two 105,000-dalton A subunits and two 95,000-dalton B subunits encoded by gyrA and gyrB genes, respectively. The A subunits, which carry out the strand-cutting function of the gyrase, are the site of action of the quinolones. DNA gyrase inhibition disrupts DNA replication and repair, transcription, bacterial chromosome separation during division, and other cell processes involving DNA. The drugs inhibit gyrase-mediated DNA supercoiling at similar concentrations that are required to inhibit bacterial growth (0.1 to 10 μg/mL). Mutations in gyrA gene that encodes the A subunit of the polypeptide can confer resistance to these drugs. Eukaryotic cells lack DNA gyrase but have a similar type of topoisomerase that can remove positive supercoils from eukaryotic DNA to prevent its tangling during replication. Quinolones inhibit eukaryotic topoisomerase at much higher concentrations (100 to 1000 μg/mL).</p>
        <p>Although bacterial DNA is compacted as large circular chromosomes with a single replication origin, most eukaryotic DNA is much more highly organized and is associated with many proteins to form chromatin that contains multiple replication origins. The general structure of chromatin has been found to be remarkably similar in the cells of all eukaryotes. The most abundant proteins associated with eukaryotic DNA (somewhat more than half its mass) are histones, a family of basic proteins rich in the positively charged amino acids lysine and/or arginine, which interact with the negatively charged phosphate groups in DNA. There are five types of histones that are evolutionarily conserved: H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Eight histone molecules (two each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) form an ellipsoid approximately 11 nm long and 6.5 nm in diameter. DNA coiled around the surface of this ellipsoid is termed the nucleosome core particle and has approximately 13/4 turns or 166 bp before it proceeds on to the next. The complex of histones plus DNA resembles a bead-like structure and is called a nucleosome.</p>
        <p>Composed of DNA and histones, nucleosomes are approximately 10 nm in diameter and are primary structural units of chromatin. Between every two nucleosomes there is a stretch of DNA, the linker region, which varies in length from 15 to over 55 bp. Histone H1 can associate with the linker region to aid in folding of DNA into more complex chromatin structures. The question of how the highly ordered nucleosome is formed can be explained by the fact that nucleosome assembly is facilitated by molecular chaperones. In the presence of nucleoplasmin (an acidic protein) and DNA topoisomerase I (nicking-closing enzyme) the nucleosome assembly proceeds rapidly without histone precipitation. Nucleoplasmin binds to histones but not to DNA or nucleosomes. It functions as a molecular chaperone to bring histones and DNA together in a controlled fashion and prevents their nonspecific aggregation through their otherwise strong electrostatic interactions. The nicking-closing enzyme acts to provide the nucleosome with its preferred level of supercoiling. Six nucleosomes are packed per turn further into a spiral or solenoid to form a regular array of polynucleosomes of 30 nm length.</p>
        <p>As a 30-nm fiber, the typical human chromosome would be 0.1 cm in length and could span the nucleus more than 100 times. Clearly, there must be a still higher level of folding. This higher order packaging is one of the most fascinating but also most poorly understood aspects of chromatin. Chromosomes are generally decondensed during interphase. Several studies of interphase chromosomes have suggested that each long DNA molecule in a chromosome is divided into a large number of discrete domains that are folded differently. The regions that are least condensed correlate well with the regions that are actively synthesizing RNA. All chromosomes adopt a highly condensed conformation during mitosis and reflect a coarse heterogeneity of chromosome structure. Other complex chromosomal structures found in eukaryotes are in histone-depleted metaphase chromosomes. These structures form radial loops around a central fibrous protein called scaffold. Most of these loops are organized into condensed 300 Å filaments but the exact nature of these formations is not known. Nonhistone proteins, whose hundreds of varieties constitute approximately 10 percent of chromosomal proteins, are thought to be involved in these processes.</p>

            [10.1] D. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that will inhibit the strand-cutting function of A subunit of DNA gyrase, a bacterial topoisomerase II that introduces negative supercoils ahead of the replication fork. This disrupts DNA replication and repair, transcription, bacterial chromosome separation, and other bacterial processes involving DNA. At much higher concentrations, the type II topoisomerases of eukaryotic cells can be inhibited.<br>
            [10.2] B. When lysine residues in the N-terminal portion of histones are acetylated, it decreases the positive charge of the histone proteins and weakens the interaction between the histones and the DNA. As a result, the nucleosomes are “opened up” and lead to gene activation.<br>
            [10.3] A. Nucleosomes are disk-shaped particles that consist of a core of histone protein around which DNA is wrapped. A short linker region of DNA joins nucleosomes. The core of the nucleosomes is made up of two copies each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. These histone proteins have N-terminal “tails” that contain lysine residues that can be reversibly acetylated, affecting the electrostatic interaction of the DNA with the histones. Histone H1 is not part of the nucleosomes core, therefore acetylation would likely not affect the protein–DNA interaction of the nucleosomes.

        </ul>

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>This young woman has developed breast cancer at age 32 years. Moreover, she has two first-degree relatives with breast and/or ovarian cancer prior to menopause. This makes BRCA gene mutation likely. The BRCA1 gene resides on chromosome 17. This gene encodes a protein which most likely is important in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair. Thus, a mutation of the BRCA1 gene likely leads to abnormal cells propagating unchecked. A woman with a BRCA1 mutation has a 70 percent lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, and a 30 to 40 percent risk of ovarian cancer. The vast majority of breast cancer is not genetically based, but occurs sporadically. However, familial-based breast cancers are most common because of BRCA1 mutation. BRCA2 is another mutation that is more commonly associated with male breast cancer. Other genetic mechanisms of cancer include oncogenes, which are abnormal genes that cause cancer usually by mutations. Protooncogenes are normal genes that are present in normal cells and involved in normal growth and development, but if mutations occur, they may become oncogenes.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>DNA replication normally occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle. DNA replication occurs in a semiconservative fashion and this is because of the intrinsic antiparallel nature of the double helix. All known DNA polymerases synthesize DNA in a 5′ to 3′ direction; this means that one strand will be continuously synthesized and the other must be made through a discontinuous mechanism and the production of Okazaki fragments. After this process is finished, the cell will divide the newly replicated material in mitosis. In some aberrant cases, the cell will replicate its DNA over and over again without performing an intervening mitosis. This generates cells with abnormally high content of DNA, an abnormal form of DNA replication control.</p>
        <p>DNA replication begins by separating the parental DNA strands. This is accomplished by enzymes called helicases. They separate the strands and move along the strands in a fixed direction at the expense of ATP, opening up the strands so that the DNA polymerases can bind to them. To prevent reannealing of the two strands, single-stranded binding proteins bind the two complementary strands. The next step in the replication process is the laying down of an RNA primer, which is catalyzed by the enzyme primase. DNA polymerases extend the chain by adding deoxyribonucleotides to the 5′ end of the RNA primer. It does this in a continuous fashion on the leading strand, but for the lagging strand, the one with its 5′ end toward the replication fork, a series of short segments termed Okazaki fragments must be synthesized. The RNA primers of the Okazaki fragments are removed as the DNA polymerase reaches the previous Okazaki fragment and the DNA segments are then joined by DNA ligase.</p>
        <p>DNA mutations arise from a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Our genome is constantly under the assault of various genotoxic agents such as ionizing radiation, oxygen free radicals, and UV light. These agents serve to introduce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) as well as thymine–thymine dimers into the DNA. DSBs may generate deletion or insertion mutations and could alter the reading frame of the genetic code, an event that can easily lead to the malfunction of a protein. UV-induced dimers may generate point mutations that also alter the reading frame.</p>
        <p>To respond to the various forms of DNA damage, cells have evolved a host of DNA repair mechanisms that serve to restore the genetic material. Depending on the nature of the DNA damage (DSB versus ultraviolet [UV]-induced thymine dimers, etc.), the cell will invoke a different mechanism of repair. In addition, the stage of the cell cycle at which the lesion is detected and processed can activate independent DNA repair pathways. For example, if a daughter chromatid template is present in S or G2 phase of the cell cycle, the cell will use this unperturbed partner molecule to fix a DSB. This process is referred to as homologous recombination (HR) and represents a major branch of the DNA repair process. However, if the damage occurs during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, a period devoid of an existing chromatid template that can be used for repair, a general end joining process will be used. This process, referred to as nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), ligates the broken ends together with little to no regard for the loss of intervening sequences. Therefore, NHEJ is considered an error-prone process, but given the large size of the genome and the presence of many forms of “junk DNA,” the NHEJ process may not necessarily disrupt DNA sequences that encode proteins. In contrast to NHEJ, HR is a process that is error-free by virtue of the fact that the daughter chromatid is used as a template for repair.</p>
        <p>Recombination and transposition of genes are two processes that mutate the genetic material. As discussed above, recombination is integral to the process of DNA repair. When DNA recombination is impaired through mutation of specific genes (like BRCA1 or Rad51), aberrant recombination takes place, generating abnormal chromosomes that possess translocations from two or more chromosomes. Translocations transpose genes from one chromosomal environment to another and often this leads to a disruption in gene expression. Such events are known to cause gene amplification, a phenomenon often associated with cancer. They may also generate chromosomes that possess two centromeres (dicentrics), leading to a variety of cellular defects in mitosis.</p>
        <p>DNA replication is tightly controlled by a variety of proteins that act to promote the process (i.e., DNA polymerases and cis-acting elements that bind to DNA and recruit factors involved in the process) as well as ones that inhibit the synthesis of DNA, either directly or indirectly. One factor that indirectly inhibits DNA synthesis is the p53 tumor suppressor. Tumor suppressors refer to a general class of proteins that function to slow and alter cell growth and development through a variety of mechanisms. In the absence of these factors, cells will have a reduced capacity to perform a variety of functions essential to maintain genomic stability. The p53 functions to control the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle, and if the cell is not prepared to enter S phase, then DNA synthesis will be negatively regulated.</p>
        <p>A major cause of familial breast cancer results from mutation in the breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1. Originally identified in 1994, it was not until 1997 when David Livingston and colleagues demonstrated that BRCA1 is a nuclear protein that its function began to be understood. They found that after treatment of cells with agents known to generate DNA damage (i.e., hydroxyurea, UV light, ionizing radiation), BRCA1 was found to localize to discrete nuclear structures typically called foci. Such foci are known to correlate with sites of DNA damage or the sites of stalled replication forks in S phase of the cell cycle. In addition to the striking nuclear localization of BRCA1 in response to DNA damaging agents, it was also observed that the BRCA1 protein was phosphorylated in response to these agents. Given this and the wealth of data obtained from studying the cell cycle in yeast model systems, it was concluded that BRCA1 functioned as a cell cycle regulator in response to DNA damage.</p>
        <p>Further studies have implicated BRCA1 in the cellular response to DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs), a potentially lethal form of DNA damage. Cells defective in BRCA1 possess numerous cytological and biological features that have been known for years to be correlated with perturbation in the maintenance of chromosome stability. This includes aneuploidy, centrosome amplification, spontaneous chromosome breakage, aberrant recombination events, sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and impaired cell cycle checkpoints. In addition, a variety of experiments have demonstrated roles for BRCA1 in enforcing the G2/M cell cycle transition, homologous recombination between sister chromatids, as well as the restart of stalled replication in S phase.</p>
        <p>The BRCA1 tumor suppressor interacts with numerous cellular proteins in large complexes. This includes a variety of proteins implicated in various DNA repair and cell cycle processes. In fact, BRCA1 has been reported to interact with as many as 50 proteins! Moreover, BRCA1 has been shown to function in various transcriptional mechanisms, suggesting that the function of this important protein may go well beyond its well-documented role in DSB repair. How the inactivation of BRCA1, a gene that appears to operate in DNA repair pathways that appear generic to various cell types and predisposes women to inherited forms of breast cancer, remains a mystery and the subject of much debate. Given that BRCA1 appears to have key roles in transcriptional regulation, it has been suggested that BRCA1 could influence mammary tissue through pathways that impinge on the biology of estrogen and estrogen-related metabolites. In addition, it has been suggested that breast tissue differs from other tissues in the types of DNA repair processes that are used. Perhaps there are redundant DNA repair pathways in non-mammary tissue. In any event, the complex behavior of BRCA1 promises to challenge future researchers as they search for the underlying mechanisms that initiate familial breast cancer.</p>

        <h3>Answers</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            [11.1] A. The RB1 protein binds to E2F transcription factors, preventing them from activating transcription of the genes encoding enzymes required for DNA replication, such as DNA polymerase. The RB1–E2F complex acts as a transcription repressor. Midway through G1 phase, RB1 is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases, releasing E2F to activate transcription. A deficiency of RB1 leads to unregulated transcription of DNA replicatory enzymes and DNA synthesis.<br>
            [11.2] B. Since BRCA1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, then one allele is sufficient to produce the BRCA1 protein. However, if the normal allele is somatically mutated or deleted, then the affected cell cannot produce the BRCA1 protein and can be transformed into a tumor cell.<br>
            [11.3] D. BRCA1 plays a significant role in the repair of double-strand breaks, therefore, since homologous recombination requires a cleavage of both strands of a DNA molecule, this event is most likely to be affected by a deficiency in this protein. Thymine dimers, mismatches, and adducts of DNA with carcinogens are effectively removed by a process of excision repair, in which a section of one strand of DNA is removed.

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>Thiamine (vitamin B1) is an important water-soluble vitamin that, in its active form of thiamine pyrophosphate, is used as a cofactor in enzymatic reactions that involve the transfer of an aldehyde group. Thiamine can be synthesized by plants and some microorganisms, but not usually by animals. Hence, humans must obtain thiamine from the diet, though small amounts may be obtained from synthesis by intestinal bacteria. Because of its importance in metabolic reactions, it is present in large amounts in skeletal muscle, heart, liver, kidney, and brain. Thus, it has a widespread distribution in foods, but there can be a substantial loss of thiamine during cooking above 100°C (212°F).</p>
        <p>Thiamine is absorbed in the intestine by both active transport mechanisms and passive diffusion. The active form of the cofactor, thiamine pyrophosphate (thiamine diphosphate, TPP), is synthesized by an enzymatic transfer of a pyrophosphate group from ATP to thiamine (Figure 15-1). The resulting TPP has a reactive carbon on the thiazole ring that is easily ionized to form a carbanion, which can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions.</p>
        <img src="figure15-1.png" alt="Figure 15-1: Activation of thiamine to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)" />
        <p>Thiamine pyrophosphate is an essential cofactor for enzymes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of α-keto acids to form an acylated coenzyme A (acyl CoA). These include pyruvate dehydrogenase (pyruvate → acetyl-CoA), α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KG → succinyl-CoA), and branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase. These three enzymes operate by a similar catalytic mechanism (Figure 15-2). Each of these enzymes is a multi-subunit complex with three enzymatic activities that require the participation of several cofactors.</p>
        <img src="figure15-2.png" alt="Figure 15-2: Catalytic mechanism of pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase" />
        <p>Thiamine pyrophosphate is also an important cofactor for the transketolase reactions in the pentose phosphate pathway of carbohydrate metabolism (Figure 15-3). These reactions are important in the reversible transformation of pentoses into the glycolytic intermediates fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.</p>
        <img src="figure15-3.png" alt="Figure 15-3: Reaction catalyzed by transketolase" />
        <p>A deficiency in thiamine will decrease the efficiency of the enzymes for which TPP is required as a cofactor. Thus, the rate of conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and the flow of acetyl-CoA through the tricarboxylic acid cycle will be depressed as a result of the inefficiency of the TPP-requiring enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The production of the reduced electron carrier, NADH, and the ATP produced from it via oxidative phosphorylation will be decreased as a consequence.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Clinical Correlation</h2>
        <p>Carbon monoxide (CO) binds avidly to hemoglobin, preventing oxygen delivery to tissues. It is a colorless, odorless gas from incomplete combustion. Symptoms include confusion and O2 deprivation, with red lips due to carboxyhemoglobin. CO also disrupts the electron transport chain, reducing ATP production. Treatment involves 100% O2 or hyperbaric oxygen to displace CO.</p>

She reports no medical problems, but has not seen a doctor in many years. On examination she is an obese female in no acute distress. Her physical exam is otherwise normal. The urinalysis revealed large glucose, and a serum random blood sugar level was 320 mg/dL.</p>

            <h3>Answers to Case 22: Type II Diabetes</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 50-year-old obese Hispanic female presents with polydipsia, polyphagia, and urinary frequency and elevated random blood sugar of 320 mg/dL.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Type II diabetes.</li>
                <li><strong>Other organ systems involved:</strong> Cardiovascular, eye, peripheral nerves, gastrointestinal, kidney.</li>
                <li><strong>Biochemical basis:</strong> Insulin resistance as a result of a postinsulin receptor defect. The insulin levels are normal or increased as compared with normal individuals; however, the insulin is not “recognized,” and thus the glucose levels remain elevated.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Clinical Correlation</h2>
            <p>Diabetes mellitus is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. It is composed of two types depending on the pathogenesis. Type I diabetes is characterized by insulin deficiency and usually has its onset during childhood or teenage years. This is also called ketosis-prone diabetes. Type II diabetes is caused by insulin resistance and usually has elevated insulin levels, and it is diagnosed in the adult years. Type II diabetes is far more common than type I diabetes. Risk factors include obesity, family history, sedentary lifestyle, and, in women, hyperandrogenic states or anovulation.</p>
            <p>Diabetes mellitus is now recognized as one of the most common and significant diseases facing Americans. It is estimated that 1 of 4 children born today will become diabetic in their lifetime because of obesity and inactivity. Also, it has been noted that diabetes has a severe effect on blood vessels, particularly in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (blockage of arteries by lipids and plaque), which can lead to myocardial infarction or stroke. Diabetes mellitus is treated as equivalent to a prior cardiovascular event in its risk for future atherosclerotic disease. Diabetes is also associated with immunosuppression, renal insufficiency, blindness, neuropathy, and other metabolic disorders.</p>

                <li><strong>Diabetes mellitus:</strong> An endocrine disease characterized by an elevated blood glucose concentration. There are two major forms of diabetes mellitus: type I, or insulin-dependent, and type II, or non–insulin-dependent. Type I is caused by a severe lack or complete absence of insulin. Type II is caused by resistance to insulin, that is, an inability to respond to physiologic concentrations of insulin.</li>

Insulin is released in response to elevations in blood glucose and promotes the uptake of glucose into cells by increasing the number of GLUT 4 glucose transporters on cell surfaces.</li>

            </ul>
            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>Every cell in the human body uses glucose as an energy source. Indeed, certain cells have an obligate requirement for glucose to meet their energetic demands (e.g., erythrocytes). Neurons, although can use alternative fuel sources under extreme conditions (e.g., ketone bodies during prolonged starvation), have a strong preference toward glucose utilization. Circulating levels of glucose must therefore be maintained sufficiently high to meet the energy demands of the body. Chronic elevations in blood glucose levels are also detrimental, being associated with oxidative stress and glycation of cellular proteins. It has been suggested that the latter mediate many of the complications associated with chronic hyperglycemia, such as diabetic microvascular disease and retinopathy.</p>
            <p>Despite diurnal variations in meal times, blood glucose levels are normally maintained within a narrow range. This is made possible in large part by the counter regulatory actions of the peptide hormones insulin and glucagon. Insulin, secreted by the β-cells of pancreatic islets when blood glucose levels increase, promotes glucose utilization and represses endogenous glucose production (Figure 22-1a). In contrast, glucagon, secreted by the α-cells of pancreatic islets when blood glucose levels are low, represses glucose utilization and promotes endogenous glucose production (Figure 22-1b). A careful balance between the actions of insulin and glucagon therefore help maintain blood glucose levels within a normal range.</p>
            <p><em>[Placeholder for Figure 22-1a: The flow of glucose to tissues under conditions of elevated blood glucose concentration.]</em></p>
            <p><em>[Placeholder for Figure 22-1b: The flow of glucose to tissues under conditions of low blood glucose concentration.]</em></p>
            <p>Insulin receptors are essentially expressed ubiquitously, in large part as a result of the mitogenic actions of this peptide hormone. In terms of glucose metabolism, the actions of insulin on the liver, adipose, and skeletal muscle will be the focus of this discussion, although insulin-mediated changes in satiety and blood flow undoubtedly play a role in whole body glucose homeostasis. On binding to its cell surface receptor, insulin elicits a complex cascade of cellular signaling events that have not been elucidated fully to date. This in turn increases glucose transport into the cell (skeletal muscle and adipose), promotes storage of excess carbon from glucose as glycogen (skeletal muscle and liver) and triglyceride (TAG; liver and adipose), increases glucose utilization as a fuel source (skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose), and decreases endogenous glucose production (liver) (see Figure 22-1a). These actions of insulin can be either acute (affecting activity of preexisting proteins) or chronic (altering protein levels).</p>
            <p>Skeletal muscle and adipose express two major isoforms of glucose transports, GLUT 1 and GLUT 4. GLUT 1, a ubiquitously expressed glucose transporter, resides almost exclusively at the cell surface, where it facilitates a constant “basal” rate of glucose uptake into the cell. In contrast, GLUT 4, whose expression is limited to skeletal muscle, heart, and adipose, can be found both at the cell surface and within specialized intracellular vesicles. Redistribution of GLUT 4 from intracellular vesicles to the cell surface in response to insulin results in increased rates of glucose transport, thereby facilitating insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. In contrast to skeletal muscle and adipose, the liver expresses GLUT 2. This is a freely reversible glucose transporter that resides permanently at the cell surface. GLUT 2 enables glucose to pass down its concentration gradient, allowing increased hepatic glucose uptake when blood glucose levels are high and increased hepatic glucose efflux when blood glucose levels are low.</p>
            <p>Once within the cell, glucose undergoes one of several fates. Insulin promotes incorporation of glucose moieties into glycogen, the storage form of glucose in mammals. This is driven in large part by insulin-mediated activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1; Figure 22-2a). PP1 dephosphorylates (hydrolytic removal of regulatory phosphate groups from serine/threonine residues on target enzymes) a number of key proteins involved in glycogen metabolism. Dephosphorylation and activation of glycogen synthase (GS), with a concomitant dephosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen phosphorylase (GP), will stimulate net glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) by liver and muscle, in response to insulin. One way in which insulin promotes PP1-mediated effects on glycogen metabolism is through the targeting of PP1 to the glycogen particle, a subcellular domain comprised of glycogen itself, as well as the enzymes required for glycogen synthesis and degradation. The glycogen binding subunit is a docking protein allowing PP1 association with the glycogen particle. Insulin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of this glycogen binding subunit, thereby promoting PP1 binding and therefore increased glycogenesis.</p>
            <p><em>[Placeholder for Figure 22-2a: Insulin stimulation of the flux of glucose through the glycolytic pathway.]</em></p>
            <p>The glycogen capacity of a cell is of finite size. Once this capacity is reached, excess glucose must undergo alternative metabolic fates. Insulin promotes flux of glucose through the glycolytic pathway (glucose → 2 pyruvate), again in part through PP1 activation (see Fig. 22-2a). As glycogenolysis is the reciprocal pathway to glycogenesis, gluconeogenesis (the synthesis of glucose) is the reciprocal pathway to glycolysis. Gluconeogenesis occurs primarily in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidney. PP1 increases glycolytic flux in the liver through activation of phosphofructokinase (PFK; indirect effect through dephosphorylation of a bifunctional enzyme, resulting in increased intracellular levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, an allosteric activator of PFK) and pyruvate kinase (PK; direct effect). Glycolytically derived pyruvate could potentially undergo one of two fates in the liver, namely, full oxidation (via Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation) and/or entry into the fatty acid synthesis pathway. However, humans on a Western diet, in which excess calories are more often a mixture of carbohydrate and fat, tend to use ingested carbohydrate as a fuel, while fatty acids are stored as triglyceride in adipose tissue. The latter is driven by insulin.</p>
            <p>When blood glucose levels begin to decline (e.g., during an overnight fast), so too does insulin secretion. In contrast, circulating levels of glucagon increase. The latter targets primarily hepatic glucose metabolism in humans, increasing glucose production and decreasing glucose utilization. On binding to its cell surface receptors, glucagon increases the activity of protein kinase A (PKA; Figure 22-2b). In turn, PKA stimulates net glycogen breakdown (glycogenolysis) through phosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase (increases activity) and glycogen synthase (decreases activity). The former phosphorylates and activates glycogen phosphorylase. PKA further antagonizes the effects of insulin through inactivation of PP1. PKA phosphorylates the glycogen binding subunit at specific serine residues, causing the release of PP1 from the glycogen particle. Once released, PP1 binds to inhibitor 1, further inactivating PP1 activity. This PP1-inhibitor 1 association is promoted by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of inhibitor 1. Gluconeogenesis is also stimulated by glucagon-induced PKA activation, through activation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (F1,6BisPase; indirect effect through phosphorylation of a bifunctional enzyme, resulting in decreased intracellular levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, an allosteric inhibitor of F1,6BisPase) and pyruvate kinase (reverse of PP1 effects). Glycogenolysis- and gluconeogenesis-derived glucose is exported out of the liver to help maintain blood glucose levels.</p>
            <p><em>[Placeholder for Figure 22-2b: Glucagon promotion of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver.]</em></p>
            <p>Abnormalities in the above described glucose homeostatic mechanisms arise during diabetes mellitus. Two major forms of diabetes mellitus exist, insulin-dependent (type I) and non–insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes. Type I diabetes is caused by a severe lack or complete absence of insulin. Also known as early onset diabetes, this disease is often caused by an autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β-cells. In contrast, type II diabetes is caused by insulin resistance in the face of insulin insufficiency. Insulin resistance is defined as an inability to respond to a physiologic concentration of insulin. The pancreas initially compensates by producing more insulin. At this stage, the patient is described as glucose intolerant. As the disease progresses, the degree of insulin resistance often worsens. Type II diabetes occurs when insulin secretion is not sufficient to maintain normoglycemia. The disease is thus characterized by both hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia (Figure 22-3).</p>
            <p><em>[Placeholder for Figure 22-3: Schematic diagram showing the effects of insulin resistance leading to diabetes mellitus.]</em></p>
            <p>The degree at which different organs develop insulin resistance is often not uniform. Skeletal muscle insulin-mediated glucose disposal (which is normally responsible for 60 percent of whole body glucose disposal) is generally more affected, followed next by insulin suppression of hepatic glucose output. The combination of decreased peripheral glucose utilization and increased hepatic glucose production (driven by hepatic insulin resistance as well as increased circulating glucagon levels in type II diabetics) together contribute to the hyperglycemia. Insulin signaling in adipose tissue appears least affected in type II diabetics. Hyperinsulinemia, in the face of hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia (often associated with type II diabetes), drives lipogenesis in adipose tissue and may therefore contribute to the obesity often associated with this disease.</p>

            <p>A 64-year-old man is presented to his family doctor with complaints of frequent episodes of dizziness and of numbness in his legs. During a routine history and physical examination, the doctor finds that the patient leads a sedentary lifestyle, is obese (body mass index of 32), and has hypertension (blood pressure of 200/120 mm Hg). The patient is asked to return to the clinic a week later in the fasting state, during which time a blood specimen is obtained, and a glucose tolerance test is performed. Humoral analysis reveals fasting hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance. The diagnosis is type II diabetes mellitus.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong> C. Of the organs listed, changes in hepatic metabolism are most likely to affect circulating glucose and lipids. This in turn influences pancreatic insulin secretion. During type II diabetes mellitus, increased hepatic glucose output contributes to the observed hyperglycemia and subsequent hyperinsulinemia, whereas complex alterations in lipid metabolism contribute to dyslipidemia. In contrast, changes in metabolic fluxes within the brain, kidney, heart, and spleen are often a consequence, rather than cause, of their environment. For example, the heart increases further reliance on fatty acids as a fuel in the diabetic milieu.

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong> E. The underlying cause of type II diabetes mellitus is insulin resistance (an inability to respond normally to physiological concentrations of insulin). Protein phosphatase 1 is an integral mediator of the metabolic effects of insulin. Failure to activate protein phosphatase 1 adequately in response to insulin would therefore attenuate the metabolic actions of this hormone. Decreased activity of glucose transporter 1, glycogen phosphorylase, and pyruvate carboxylase would influence basal glucose transport, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis, respectively. Decreased glucagon levels would tend to improve effectiveness of insulin action.

                <strong>Answer:</strong> D. Hypoglycemia is a common complication associated with over supplementation of type I diabetics with insulin. This is less common in type II diabetics, because insulin therapy generally occurs only in the later stages of the pathogenesis of this disease. Retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and neuropathy are common complications associated with both forms of diabetes mellitus. In contrast to type I diabetics, type II diabetics tend to be overweight.

            <h1>Case 23: Hemolytic Anemia</h1>
            <p>A 2-year-old black girl is being seen by the hematologist after her pediatrician found her to be severely anemic with splenomegaly and jaundice. Her mother gives a possible history of a “blood problem” in her family but doesn’t know for sure. Her hemoglobin electrophoresis was normal, and the complete blood count (CBC) revealed a normocytic anemia. The platelet and white blood cell counts are normal. On the peripheral smear, there are many bizarre erythrocytes, including spiculated cells. A diagnosis of pyruvate kinase deficiency is made.</p>
            <h3>Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the biochemical mechanism for this disorder?</li>
                <li>How is this disorder inherited?</li>

            <h3>Answers to Case 23: Hemolytic Anemia</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 2-year-old black girl has normocytic anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly, and peripheral smear showing spiculated cells. A family history of similar symptoms is possible.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biochemical mechanism:</strong> Pyruvate kinase deficiency usually will manifest clinical symptoms on red blood cells (RBCs) with no apparent metabolic abnormalities in other cells. Insufficient adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is produced in the red cell and its membrane is affected, is rigid and removed by the spleen.</li>
                <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Autosomal recessive.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Clinical Correlation</h2>
            <p>Hemolytic anemia is not a common cause of anemia, but should be considered in patients with elevated serum bilirubin or urine bilirubin levels. Lysis of the erythrocyte can occur from various mechanisms such as medications, antibodies against red blood cells, infection, coagulopathy, and mechanical processes such as abnormal heart valves, and enzyme deficiencies of the red blood cell. Patients may notice fatigue, dizziness from the anemia, and dark colored (classically “coke-colored” urine) from the bilirubinuria.</p>
            <p>Confirmation of hemolysis can be obtained by the peripheral blood smear revealing fragmented red blood cells, or increased serum bilirubin or decreased serum haptoglobin. Immunoglobulins can cause red blood cell lysis by attacking various proteins on the surface of erythrocytes; autoimmune processes (body attacking itself), or alloimmune (immunoglobulins from outside) such as from a blood transfusion or a fetus from the mother. The Coombs tests can assess for immunoglobulin on the red blood cell or circulating in the serum. Typically, hemolysis of the erythrocyte is associated with increased levels of RBC precursors in the bone marrow and thus immature forms of the erythrocytes in the bloodstream; therefore, an increased reticulocyte concentration supports the increased destruction of red blood cells.</p>

            </ul>
            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>Hemolytic anemia has many causes, though this case has the marks of undersupply of RBCs caused by an enzyme deficiency within the RBC rather than a membrane abnormality or an environmental factor such as an autoantibody or mechanical trauma.</p>
            <p>The RBC in the course of its maturation loses its mitochondria, ribosomes, and nucleus and consequently the functions associated with those organelles such as new enzyme synthesis and mitochondrial energy formation. Thus the enzyme endowment present at maturation of the RBC cannot be replaced. In terms of energy production in the RBC, only the glycolytic pathway (Embden-Meyerhof pathway) is available. This pathway together with the hexose monophosphate shunt (pentose phosphate pathway) is shown in Figure 23-1 as the only metabolic pathways that use glucose in RBCs. As a consequence of this limited metabolic capacity, glucose is the only fuel usable by the RBC to generate ATP. Glucose metabolism is required in the RBC to maintain the ionic milieu within the cell, to maintain the heme cofactor of hemoglobin in its reduced (Fe2+) state, to maintain reduced sulfhydryl groups, to maintain the shape of the RBC plasma membrane and to produce 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, a modulator of hemoglobin affinity for oxygen. To accomplish these tasks approximately 90 percent of the glucose in the RBC is metabolized directly to pyruvate/lactate while approximately 10 percent is first metabolized through the hexose monophosphate shunt before reentry into the glycolytic pathway.</p>
            <p><em>[Placeholder for Figure 23-1: Metabolism of glucose in erythrocytes.]</em></p>
            <p>Approximately 90 percent of all cases of known RBC enzyme deficiencies involve either altered protein or decreased protein levels of pyruvate kinase whereas 4 percent are variants of glucose 6-phosphate isomerase, which converts glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate. Most of these enzyme deficiencies are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.</p>
            <p>As shown in Figure 23-1, 2 mol of ATP are formed per mole of glucose metabolized by the glycolytic cycle. The primary final product of glucose metabolism by glycolysis in the RBC is not pyruvate, as in other tissues most of the time, but lactate. Since RBCs have no mitochondria, NAD+ cannot be regenerated by shuttling NADH produced in glycolysis into the mitochondrial electron transport system. Therefore, the only option to continue glycolysis is to regenerate NAD+ from NADH by reducing pyruvate to lactate in the lactate dehydrogenase reaction. But lactate is not the sole product of RBC glycolysis. Methemoglobin reductase uses some of the NADH produced by glycolysis to reduce methemoglobin (Fe3+) back to active hemoglobin (Fe2+) capable of binding O2 for transport to the tissues. Thus the final products are a mixture of lactate and pyruvate with lactate being the primary product.</p>
            <p>In tissues other than the RBC, pyruvate has alternative metabolic fates that, depending on the tissue, include gluconeogenesis, conversion to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase for further metabolism to CO2 in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, transamination to alanine or carboxylation to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase (Table 23-1). In the RBC, however, the restricted enzymatic endowment precludes all but the conversion to lactate. The pyruvate and lactate produced are end products of RBC glycolysis that are transported out of the RBC to the liver where they can undergo the alternative metabolic conversions described above.</p>

            <p>How does compromise of pyruvate kinase activity lead to anemia? Pyruvate kinase lies at the end of the glycolytic pathway in RBCs followed only by lactate dehydrogenase. In any linked pathway where the product of one reaction is the substrate for the next reaction a compromise in one reaction affects the entire pathway. The RBC depends exclusively on glycolysis to produce ATP to discharge all energy-requiring tasks. Pyruvate kinase activity is critical for the pathway and therefore critical for energy production. If ATP is not produced in amounts sufficient to meet the energy demand, then those functions are compromised. Energy is required to maintain the Na+/K+ balance within the RBC and to maintain the flexible discoid shape of the cell. In the absence of sufficient pyruvate kinase activity and therefore ATP, the ionic balance fails, and the membrane becomes misshapen. Cells reflecting pyruvate kinase insufficiency rather than a change in membrane composition are removed from the circulation by the macrophages of the spleen. This results in an increased number of circulating reticulocytes and possibly bone marrow hyperplasia, which is a biological response to lowered RBC count as a result of hemolysis of erythrocytes.</p>

            <div class="question">
                [23.1] Since in this patient pyruvate kinase is abnormal not only is less pyruvate made but intermediates above pyruvate in the glycolytic pathway build up slowing the pathway. Which of the following products may not be made in the appropriate amounts in the RBC because of the deficiency of pyruvate?
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Glucose</li>
                    <li>Oxaloacetate</li>

                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong> D. The RBC has no mitochondria so glucose cannot be made from pyruvate or acetyl-CoA or oxaloacetate. The RBC does have lactate dehydrogenase and conversion to lactate depends on pyruvate levels.
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                [23.2] In the RBCs of the patient described above, which of the following would be expected?
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>ADP to ATP ratios would be elevated above normal.</li>

                    <li>Ribulose 5-phosphate levels would decrease.</li>
                    <li>NADH to NAD+ ratios would decrease.</li>
                    <li>Methemoglobin levels would increase.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong> A. In the RBC a deficiency of pyruvate kinase would tend to shunt glucose toward the hexose monophosphate pathway increasing ribulose 5-P levels, and the ratio of NADP+ to NADPH would decrease. NADH to NAD+ ratios would increase as a result of lower pyruvate levels making more NADH available to reduce methemoglobin and regenerate NAD+. Because pyruvate kinase is deficient, the last ATP formation site is compromised, and so is the formation of ATP in the RBC elevating the ADP to ATP ratio.

            <p>A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department after several episodes of vomiting and lethargy. His pediatrician has been concerned about his failure to thrive and possible hepatic failure along with recurrent episodes of the vomiting and lethargy.

            <h3>Answers to Case 24: Fructose Intolerance</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 3-year-old boy with failure to thrive and possible hepatic failure. He presents with hypoglycemia and recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting after ingestion of foods high in fructose.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Fructose intolerance.</li>
                <li><strong>Biochemical basis of disorder:</strong> Because of a genetic disorder, the hepatic aldolase B enzyme is defective, and functions normally in glycolysis but not in fructose metabolism. Glucose production is inhibited by elevated fructose 1-phosphate. When fructose is ingested, severe hypoglycemia results.</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Avoid dietary fructose.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Clinical Correlation</h2>
            <p>Individuals with a deficiency in aldolase B have the condition known as fructose intolerance. As with most enzyme deficiencies, this is an autosomal recessive disease; it does not cause difficulty as long as the patient does not consume any foods with fructose or sucrose. Frequently, children with fructose intolerance avoid candy and fruit, which should raise some eyebrows! Likewise, they usually do not have many dental caries. However, if chronically exposed to fructose-containing foods, infants and small children may have poor weight gain and abdominal cramping or vomiting.</p>

            <h3>Definitions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Disaccharide:</strong> Two sugar molecules (monosaccharides) linked together by a glycosidic bond. The major disaccharides obtained in the diet are maltose [4-(α-D-glucosido)-D-glucose], sucrose [β-D-fructofuranosyl-α-D-glucopyranoside], and lactose [4-(β-D-galactosido)-D-glucose].</li>
                <li><strong>Essential fructosuria:</strong> A rare, benign genetic condition in which fructose spills over to the urine because the liver, kidney, and intestine lack the enzyme fructokinase.</li>
                <li><strong>Fructokinase:</strong> An enzyme present in the liver, kidney, and intestine that will phosphorylate fructose to fructose 1-phosphate at the expense of an ATP.</li>
                <li><strong>Fructose intolerance:</strong> A genetic deficiency in the liver enzyme aldolase B. The absence of this enzyme leads to a build up of fructose 1-phosphate and depletion of liver ATP and phosphate stores.</li>
                <li><strong>GLUT 5:</strong> A facilitative glucose transporter isoform present in the small intestine and other tissues that will transport fructose (and glucose to a lesser extent) across the plasma membrane.</li>
                <li><strong>β-Glycosidase:</strong> A bifunctional, membrane-bound enzyme located on the brush-border membrane of the small intestine.

                <li><strong>SGLT1:</strong> A sodium-dependent glucose transporter located on the luminal side of the intestinal epithelial cells. It will transport glucose and galactose across the intestinal cell using a sodium ion gradient.</li>
                <li><strong>SGLT2:</strong> A sodium-dependent glucose transporter that has a high specificity for glucose and is specific to the kidney.</li>
                <li><strong>Sucrase-isomaltase complex:</strong> An enzyme complex comprised of two enzyme units. Both units have high α-1,4-glucosidase activity and will hydrolyze maltose and maltotriose to glucose. The sucrase unit will also hydrolyze sucrose to fructose and glucose, whereas the isomaltase unit will hydrolyze α-1,6 bonds found in isomaltose and the limit dextrins of starch.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>The major disaccharides obtained in the diet are maltose, sucrose, and lactose. Maltose is primarily obtained from the consumption of the plant storage polysaccharide starch. Starch is degraded to glucose and small branched oligosaccharides called limit dextrins by exhaustive digestion by α-amylase. The limit dextrins are further enzymatically hydrolyzed to a branched tetrasaccharide by glucoamylase and to maltotriose and maltose and ultimately to glucose by the sucrase-isomaltase complex. Both of these enzyme complexes are located on the brush-border membrane of the small intestine. Sucrose, or table sugar, is hydrolyzed to glucose and fructose by the sucrase subunit of the sucrase-isomaltase complex. Lactose, or milk sugar, is enzymatically converted to glucose and galactose by β-glycosidase, also located on the brush-border membrane of the small intestine. This membrane-bound enzyme is a single polypeptide that has lactase and glycosylceramidase activities located in different domains of the protein.</p>
            <p>Glucose and galactose are absorbed from the lumen of the intestine by the sodium-dependent glucose transporter, SGLT1, which is located on the luminal side of the intestinal epithelial cells. Fructose absorption is not dependent on a sodium gradient. It is transported into the intestinal cell by facilitative diffusion by a glucose transporter isoform, GLUT 5. Fructose transport is less rapid than glucose transport, and GLUT 5 does not have a high capacity. Thus, in most individuals, ingestion of fructose in amounts greater than 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg body weight can result in malabsorption. Fructose enters the bloodstream, along with glucose and galactose, via the GLUT 2 transporter. Fructose is taken up by the liver by the same GLUT 2 transporter, along with glucose and galactose. There is a large gradient between the extracellular and intracellular concentrations of fructose in the liver cells, indicating that the rate for fructose uptake by the hepatocyte is low.</p>
            <p>In the liver, kidney, and intestine, fructose can be converted to glycolytic/gluconeogenic intermediates by the actions of three enzymes—fructokinase, aldolase B, and triokinase (also called triose kinase)—as shown in Figure 24-1. In these tissues, fructose is rapidly phosphorylated to fructose 1-phosphate (F1P) by fructokinase at the expense of a molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This has the effect of trapping fructose inside the cell. A deficiency in this enzyme leads to the rare but benign condition known as essential fructosuria. In other tissues such as muscle, adipose, and red blood cells, hexokinase can phosphorylate fructose to the glycolytic intermediate fructose 6-phosphate (F6P).</p>
            <p><em>[Placeholder for Figure 24-1: The metabolic pathway for the entrance of fructose into the glycolytic pathway.]</em></p>
            <p>Fructose 1-phosphate is further metabolized to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde by the hepatic isoform of the enzyme aldolase, which catalyzes a reversible aldol condensation reaction. Aldolase is present in three different isoforms. Aldolase A is present in greatest concentrations in the skeletal muscle, whereas the B isoform predominates in the liver, kidney, and intestine. Aldolase C is the brain isoform. Aldolase B has similar activity for either fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F16BP) or F1P; however, the A or C isoforms are only slightly active when F1P is the substrate. Glyceraldehyde may be converted to the glycolytic intermediate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP), by the action of the enzyme triokinase. This enzyme phosphorylates glyceraldehyde at the expense of another molecule of ATP. The GAP can then enter into the glycolytic pathway and be further converted to pyruvate, or recombine with DHAP to form F16BP by the action of aldolase.</p>
            <p>A deficiency in aldolase B leads to the condition known as fructose intolerance. This inherited condition is benign as long as the patient does not consume any foods with fructose or sucrose. Patients with this condition usually develop an aversion to sweets early in life and as a result frequently are without any caries. However, infants and small children if chronically exposed to fructose-containing foods usually exhibit periods of vomiting and poor feeding, as well as a failure to thrive. A defect in the aldolase B gene results in a decrease in activity that is 15 percent or less than that of normal controls. This results in a buildup of F1P levels in the hepatocyte. Because the maximal rate of fructose phosphorylation by fructokinase is so high (almost an order of magnitude greater than that of glucokinase), intracellular levels of both ATP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) are significantly decreased. The drop in ATP concentration adversely affects a number of cellular events, including detoxification of ammonia, formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP), and ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein synthesis. The decrease in intracellular concentrations of Pi leads to a hyperuricemic condition as a result of an increase in uric acid formation. AMP deaminase is inhibited by normal cellular concentrations of Pi. When these levels drop, the inhibition is released and AMP is converted to IMP and, ultimately, uric acid (Figure 24-2).</p>

            <p>The toxic effects of F1P can also be exhibited in patients that do not have a deficiency in aldolase B if they are parenterally fed with solutions containing fructose. Parenteral feeding with solutions containing fructose can result in blood fructose concentrations that are several times higher than can be achieved with an oral load. Since the rate of entry into the hepatocyte is dependent on the fructose gradient across the cell, intravenous loading results in increased entry into the liver and increased formation of F1P. Since the rate of formation of F1P is much faster than its further metabolism, this can lead to hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria by the mechanisms described above.</p>

                [24.1] A 22-year-old soldier collapses from dehydration during maneuvers in the desert and is sent to a military hospital. Prior to enlisting, a physician observed a high level of glucose in his urine during an examination. At first, he was not allowed to enlist because he was suspected of being a diabetic. Further tests, however, determined that his insulin level was normal. A glucose tolerance test exhibited a normal pattern. Laboratory tests following his dehydration episode repeat the previous findings, but further testing of the urine reveals that only D-glucose is elevated. Other sugars were not elevated. This patient’s elevated urinary glucose and his dehydration episode are caused by a deficiency in which of the following?
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>GLUT 2</li>
                    <li>GLUT 4</li>

                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong> E. The patient has normal levels of blood insulin and exhibits a normal glucose tolerance test. This indicates that glucose absorption from the intestine is normal as is clearance of glucose from the blood. The presence of glucose in the urine is most likely a kidney problem. Because the defect seems to involve only D-glucose and no other sugar, this points to a transporter with high specificity. The kidney has the GLUT 2, SGLT1, and SGLT2 transporters. GLUT 2 and SGLT1 are present in other tissues, and a defect in these would be expected to result in more serious sequelae. SGLT2 is a sodium-dependent glucose transporter specific to the kidney that has a high specificity for glucose. The glucose is present in the urine because of a failure to reabsorb it as a consequence of a defect in SGLT2. This leads to a loss of water also, because it is reabsorbed with glucose.

                [24.2] Your patient is a 7-month-old baby girl, the second child born to unrelated parents. She did not respond well to breast-feeding and was changed entirely to a formula based on cow’s milk at 4 weeks. Between 7 and 12 weeks of age, she was admitted to the hospital twice with a history of screaming after feeding, but was discharged after observation without a specific diagnosis. Elimination of cow’s milk from her diet did not relieve her symptoms; her mother reported that the screaming bouts were worse after the child drank juice and that she frequently had gas and a distended abdomen. Analysis of a liver needle biopsy did not reveal any liver enzyme deficiencies. Overall, the girl is thriving (weight greater than 97th percentile) with no abnormal findings on physical examination. If a biopsy of intestinal tissue were obtained from your patient and analyzed, which of the following would most likely be deficient or defective?
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>GLUT 2</li>

                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong> B. Because the patient’s liver enzymes are normal and her symptoms seem to correlate with her intake of fruit juices, most likely her problem stems from an inability to absorb fructose. Since removal of cow’s milk from her diet did not eliminate the problem, a lactase deficiency can be ruled out. GLUT 5 is the primary transporter of fructose in the intestine and a deficiency in this transporter would lead to an inability to absorb fructose in the gut, making it a substrate for bacterial metabolism that produces various gases, including hydrogen, as well as organic acids.

                <li><strong>Biochemical basis for fiber:</strong> Dietary fiber is composed of complex carbohydrates that are not digestible by intestinal enzymes but are fermented by colonic bacteria to short-chain fatty acids and gas.

            </ul>
            <h2>Clinical Correlation</h2>
            <p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation, or a combination of both. It is a common condition, affecting approximately 10–15% of the population, and is more prevalent in women. The exact cause of IBS is unknown, but it is thought to involve a combination of factors, including altered gut motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and possibly low-grade inflammation or changes in the gut microbiota. Stress and certain foods may exacerbate symptoms, but no specific food triggers are consistently identified. Diagnosis is typically made based on clinical criteria (e.g., Rome criteria) after ruling out other conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or colorectal cancer. Treatment often includes dietary modifications (e.g., increasing fiber intake), stress management, and sometimes medications to address specific symptoms like diarrhea or constipation.</p>

            </ul>
            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>Dietary fiber is a critical component of gastrointestinal health, influencing stool consistency, intestinal motility, and the gut microbiota. Fiber is classified into two main types: soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber (e.g., pectin, gums) dissolves in water, forming a gel-like substance that slows gastric emptying and promotes satiety. Insoluble fiber (e.g., cellulose, lignin) adds bulk to the stool, promoting peristalsis and reducing intestinal transit time. Both types are resistant to digestion by human intestinal enzymes and reach the colon, where they are fermented by the gut microbiota.</p>
            <p>In the colon, dietary fiber is broken down by anaerobic bacteria into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, along with gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen. These SCFAs serve as an energy source for colonocytes, promoting their health and integrity. Butyrate, in particular, is a preferred fuel for colonocytes and has anti-inflammatory properties that may help maintain the gut barrier. The production of SCFAs also lowers the colonic pH, which inhibits the growth of pathogenic bacteria and enhances the absorption of water and electrolytes, thereby affecting stool consistency.</p>
            <p>The increased stool bulk from insoluble fiber and the gas produced during fermentation stimulate peristalsis, which helps regulate bowel movements. This is particularly beneficial in conditions like IBS, where patients may experience constipation, diarrhea, or both. For constipation-predominant IBS, fiber increases stool bulk and softens it, making it easier to pass. For diarrhea-predominant IBS, soluble fiber can absorb water, adding form to loose stools. However, excessive fiber intake can exacerbate symptoms in some IBS patients, particularly those with bloating or gas-related discomfort, due to increased fermentation.</p>
            <p>In the case of IBS, dietary fiber is often recommended as part of a comprehensive management strategy. The increased bulk from fiber reduces intracolonic pressure, which may alleviate abdominal pain associated with IBS. Additionally, fiber can modulate gut transit time, helping to normalize bowel habits. The production of SCFAs from fiber fermentation also supports a healthy gut microbiota, which may be disrupted in IBS patients.</p>

                <strong>Answer:</strong> E. Both soluble and insoluble fiber can be beneficial for constipation-predominant IBS. Insoluble fiber (e.g., cellulose) adds bulk to the stool and promotes peristalsis, while soluble fiber (e.g., pectin) can soften the stool by absorbing water, making it easier to pass. Lignin is a type of insoluble fiber, and pectin is a type of soluble fiber, so both contribute to the overall effect.

                <li><strong>Biochemical mechanism:</strong> Nocturnal hypoglycemia stimulates the release of counter-regulatory hormones (e.g., glucagon, epinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone), which promote glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, resulting in elevated morning blood glucose levels.</li>

            </ul>
            <h2>Clinical Correlation</h2>
            <p>The Somogyi effect is a rebound hyperglycemia phenomenon seen primarily in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes (type I). It occurs when an excessive dose of insulin, particularly long-acting insulin, causes hypoglycemia during the night. This hypoglycemia triggers the release of counter-regulatory hormones, which increase blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Patients may present with high morning fasting glucose levels despite good daytime control, often accompanied by symptoms of hypoglycemia (e.g., night sweats, nightmares) or rebound hyperglycemia (e.g., fatigue, increased appetite). Differentiating the Somogyi effect from the dawn phenomenon (morning hyperglycemia due to a surge in growth hormone and cortisol) is critical, as the treatments differ. The Somogyi effect requires reducing insulin doses to prevent hypoglycemia, while the dawn phenomenon may require increasing insulin doses or adjusting the timing of administration.</p>

            </ul>
            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>Glucose homeostasis is maintained by a delicate balance between insulin and counter-regulatory hormones, including glucagon, epinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone. Insulin promotes glucose uptake and storage (glycogenesis and lipogenesis), while counter-regulatory hormones increase blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. In the Somogyi effect, excessive insulin administration leads to nocturnal hypoglycemia, which triggers the release of these counter-regulatory hormones. Glucagon and epinephrine act rapidly to stimulate glycogenolysis, breaking down hepatic glycogen stores into glucose. Cortisol and growth hormone have a slower effect, promoting gluconeogenesis by mobilizing amino acids from proteins and glycerol from triglycerides.</p>
            <p>The biochemical cascade begins with hypoglycemia, which is sensed by the pancreas and hypothalamus. This triggers glucagon secretion from pancreatic α-cells and epinephrine release from the adrenal medulla. Glucagon activates glycogen phosphorylase via a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, leading to glycogen breakdown (Figure 26-1). Simultaneously, gluconeogenesis is upregulated through the activation of enzymes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase. The resulting glucose is released into the bloodstream, causing rebound hyperglycemia by morning.</p>
            <p><em>[Placeholder for Figure 26-1: The role of counter-regulatory hormones in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.]</em></p>
            <p>Management of the Somogyi effect involves identifying and preventing nocturnal hypoglycemia. This can be achieved by monitoring blood glucose levels at night (e.g., 2–3 AM) to confirm hypoglycemia, reducing the dose of long-acting insulin, or ensuring adequate carbohydrate intake before bedtime. Continuous glucose monitoring systems can be particularly useful in detecting nocturnal hypoglycemia and guiding insulin adjustments.</p>

                [26.1] A 14-year-old girl with type I diabetes has morning blood glucose levels of 220 mg/dL, despite good daytime control. Nighttime glucose checks reveal a level of 40 mg/dL at 3 AM. Which hormone is most likely contributing to her morning hyperglycemia?
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Insulin</li>
                    <li>Glucagon</li>
                    <li>Thyroxine</li>
                    <li>Insulin-like growth factor</li>
                    <li>Parathyroid hormone</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong> B. The low glucose level at 3 AM indicates nocturnal hypoglycemia, which triggers the release of counter-regulatory hormones such as glucagon. Glucagon promotes glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, leading to rebound hyperglycemia in the morning, characteristic of the Somogyi effect.
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                [26.2] Which of the following enzymes is directly involved in the glycogenolysis pathway activated during the Somogyi effect?
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Hexokinase</li>
                    <li>Glycogen synthase</li>
                    <li>Glycogen phosphorylase</li>
                    <li>Pyruvate kinase</li>
                    <li>Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong> C. Glycogen phosphorylase is the key enzyme in glycogenolysis, breaking down glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate, which is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and ultimately glucose. This process is stimulated by glucagon and epinephrine during the Somogyi effect.

            <div class="question">
                [26.3] To confirm the Somogyi effect in a patient with type I diabetes, which of the following interventions is most appropriate?
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Increase morning insulin dose</li>
                    <li>Monitor blood glucose at 2–3 AM</li>
                    <li>Administer glucagon at bedtime</li>
                    <li>Reduce carbohydrate intake at dinner</li>
                    <li>Increase long-acting insulin dose</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong> B. Monitoring blood glucose at 2–3 AM is the most appropriate way to confirm the Somogyi effect, as it will detect nocturnal hypoglycemia that triggers rebound hyperglycemia. Adjusting insulin or carbohydrate intake without confirming hypoglycemia could exacerbate the problem.

                <h3>Biochemistry Pearls</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Somogyi effect is caused by nocturnal hypoglycemia triggering counter-regulatory hormones that promote glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.</li>
                    <li>Glucagon and epinephrine are rapid-acting counter-regulatory hormones that stimulate glycogen phosphorylase, while cortisol and growth hormone promote gluconeogenesis.</li>
                    <li>Management involves preventing nocturnal hypoglycemia through insulin dose adjustments or bedtime snacks.</li>
