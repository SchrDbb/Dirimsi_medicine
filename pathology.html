            <h2>Case 1: Barrett Esophagus</h2>
            <p>A 42-year-old policeman has been seen by his family physician for a 5-year history of “heartburn.” He has been intermittently taking ranitidine, a histamine-2 blocking agent, with some relief. An upper endoscopic examination that was performed recently revealed some reddish discoloration and friability of the lower esophageal region. A biopsy of the lower esophagus was performed, and the microscopic examination revealed columnar cells containing goblet cells.</p>
            <h3>Key Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the most likely diagnosis?</li>
                <li>What is a long-term complication of this process?</li>
                <li>What is the most likely mechanism of this process?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Answers to Case 1: Barrett Esophagus</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 42-year-old man has a 5-year history of “heartburn” unrelieved by a histamine-2 blocking agent. Upper endoscopy reveals reddish discoloration of the distal esophagus, which on biopsy shows columnar epithelium with goblet cells.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Barrett esophagus.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term complication of this process:</strong> Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.</li>
                <li><strong>Most likely mechanism:</strong> Repeated acid reflux to the distal esophagus leading to metaplasia of the normal squamous epithelium into columnar epithelium.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
            <p>The normal esophagus is lined by nonkeratinized squamous epithelium. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) prevents reflux of gastric acid from entering the distal esophagus. With gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), decreased lower esophageal sphincter tone can lead to acid exposure of the distal esophagus. Through a poorly understood mechanism, the lower esophagus changes (metaplasia) from squamous to columnar epithelium, so-called Barrett esophagus. In fact, the presence of goblet cells in the columnar epithelium is a hallmark of the disease. Barrett esophagus appears reddish and friable on endoscopy and carries an increased risk for developing into adenocarcinoma.</p>

            </ul>
            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <h4>Normal Esophagus</h4>
            <p>The esophagus is a muscular tube that connects the pharynx to the stomach that is lined by squamous epithelium. It has a well-developed submucosa, and the upper third is enveloped by striated muscle, whereas the lower two-thirds are encompassed by smooth muscle. The upper esophageal sphincter is located at approximately the level of the fifth cervical vertebra (C5) level, whereas the lower esophageal sphincter is located below the diaphragm and its function is to prevent regurgitation of gastric acid. During the swallowing process peristalsis is initiated in the striated muscle and continues down through the smooth muscle with a coordinated temporary relaxation of the LES. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers innervate the intrinsic myenteric plexus, which is distributed in the striated and smooth muscle.</p>
            <h4>Congenital Anomalies</h4>
            <p>Tracheoesophageal (TE) fistulae are congenital disorders that manifest in affected newborns as hypersalivation and difficulty feeding with choking. The most common type (90 percent) involves distal esophageal atresia with a connection to the trachea. Maternal polyhydramnios may be noted in utero, resulting from the fetal inability to swallow amniotic fluid. Less common varieties of TE fistulae may involve a fistula and patent esophagus (so-called H type) or a higher location of the fistula. Recognition and surgical repair are critical.</p>
            <h4>Achalasia</h4>
            <p>Achalasia is characterized by progressive dilation of the distal esophagus caused by disturbance of the normal peristaltic process. This nearly always involves a loss of myenteric ganglion cells, although the underlying etiology is unclear. Patients typically have increased LES pressure and complain of progressive dysphagia and vomiting of partially digested or undigested food. The diagnosis is established by endoscopy or upper gastrointestinal barium swallow imaging (so-called “bird’s beak” finding; see Figure 1-1).</p>
            <p><strong>Figure 1-1:</strong> Barium esophagogram showing a markedly dilated esophagus and characteristic “bird’s beak” in achalasia. (Reproduced, with permission, from Waters PF, DeMeester TR. Foregut motor disorders and their surgical management. Med Clin North Am 1981:65;1235.)</p>
            <h4>GERD and Barrett Esophagus</h4>
            <p>Esophagitis, or inflammation of the esophagus, has multiple etiologies and often is associated with chest pain, dysphagia, and painful swallowing. By far, the most common cause of esophagitis is gastroesophageal reflux, which may be associated with a hiatal hernia. With chronic acid exposure, the distal esophagus may become hyperemic and ulcerated and develop scars or strictures. Persistent GERD may lead to a benign epithelial change (metaplasia) of the distal esophagus; the normal squamous cell epithelium becomes columnar with the presence of intestinal goblet cells, so-called Barrett esophagus. Barrett esophagus appears reddish and friable on endoscopy and is diagnosed by biopsy; endoscopic surveillance is important because of the increased risk for developing adenocarcinoma.</p>
            <h4>Esophageal Carcinoma</h4>
            <p>Esophageal cancers account for about 10 percent of all gastrointestinal cancers in the United States and are largely asymptomatic. Familial influences are not as important as environmental exposures. Chronic alcohol and tobacco exposures significantly increase the risk of esophageal cancer. Other factors may include ingestion of nitrosamine-containing foods, chronic hot and spicy foods, and lye with stricture formation. The most common cell type worldwide is squamous cell carcinoma, usually affecting the upper and middle thirds of the esophagus. In the United States, as a result of decreased tobacco use and an increased prevalence of GERD, adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus is encountered commonly. Periodic endoscopic surveillance with biopsy for patients with chronic GERD may identify the cancer at an early stage. Regardless of cell type, affected patients generally have few symptoms until late in the course, with those symptoms being progressive dysphagia, weight loss, and fatigue. Because the cancers are usually very large at diagnosis, surgical resection is difficult, and up to 80 percent of affected individuals die within 1 year of diagnosis.</p>

            <h3>Answers</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>A.</strong> Adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the lower third of the esophagus and is strongly associated with Barrett esophagus. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer of the esophagus worldwide and usually affects the upper or middle region of the esophagus.</li>
                <li><strong>E.</strong> This patient probably has HIV, and the clinical syndrome of painful and difficult swallowing is consistent with Candida esophagitis. Endoscopy probably would reveal white plaques adherent to the esophagus. Other causes of esophagitis include herpes simplex infection, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and chemical-induced conditions such as those resulting from lye (suicide attempt).</li>
                <li><strong>D.</strong> The vast majority newborns with TE fistulae involve a nonpatent esophagus that is diagnosed by the inability to pass a feeding tube. However, the baby in this case most likely has an unusual type of TE fistula (H type) in which the esophagus is patent but there is a connection between the esophagus and the trachea. When the baby feeds, the formula is aspirated into the tracheobronchial tree, leading to choking and cyanosis. This condition may be diagnosed with a radiologic contrast study and requires surgical correction.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Pathology Pearls</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The normal esophagus is lined with nonkeratinized squamous epithelium.</li>
                <li>Gastric acid reflux into the distal esophagus may cause esophagitis, and a patient with gastroesophageal reflux disease typically complains of heartburn.</li>
                <li>GERD usually is treated with histamine-2 blocking agents or proton pump inhibitors, which decrease the gastric acid production.</li>
                <li>Long-standing GERD may lead to columnar metaplasia of the lower esophageal epithelium, so-called Barrett esophagus, which has a propensity for developing into adenocarcinoma.</li>
                <li>Chronic alcohol and tobacco exposures significantly increase the risk of esophageal cancer.</li>
                <li>Worldwide, the most common type of esophageal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma, whereas in Western countries, adenocarcinoma is increasing in incidence because of the prevalence of GERD and Barrett esophagus.</li>

            <h3>Answers to Case 2: Peptic Ulcer Disease</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 30-year-old man has acute onset of midepigastric pain somewhat relieved by eating. Upper endoscopy reveals a 2-cm gastric ulcer.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Peptic ulcer disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term complications:</strong> Erosion or perforation with bleeding; gastric carcinoma in patients with chronic gastritis.</li>
                <li><strong>Most likely mechanism:</strong> Most often associated with Helicobacter pylori organisms that produce bacterial urease and protease, damaging the mucus layer and exposing the underlying epithelium to acid-peptic injury.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
            <p>Ulcers are disruptions of the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract that extend through the muscularis mucosa into the submucosa or deeper. Peptic ulcers occur most frequently in the stomach and duodenum. Peptic ulcers are often remitting, relapsing lesions that may be seen in young adults but more often occur in middle-aged to older adults. They are usually chronic, solitary lesions caused by the action of gastric acid and pepsin, both of which are thought to be required for the development of peptic ulcers. Helicobacter pylori infection of gastric mucosa is present in 90 to 100 percent of patients with a duodenal ulcer and 70 percent of those with a gastric ulcer. Damage to the protective mucus layer by bacterial urease and protease exposes the underlying epithelial cells to the influence of acid-peptic digestion and may lead to inflammation. The chronically inflamed mucosa is more susceptible to acid-peptic injury and thus more prone to ulceration.</p>

                <li><strong>Diaphragmatic hernia:</strong> Weakness or partial to total absence of a portion of the diaphragm, usually on the left, which may permit the abdominal contents to herniate into the thorax during in utero development. Diaphragmatic hernias differ from hiatal hernias in that the defect in the diaphragm does not involve the hiatal orifice.</li>
                <li><strong>Pyloric stenosis:</strong> Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is seen in infants usually during the second or third week of life. Hypertrophy of the muscularis propria of the pylorus results in a palpable mass and obstruction with associated regurgitation and persistent projectile vomiting. Male infants are affected 3 to 4 times more often than are females. Treatment consists of surgical splitting of the muscle. Pyloric stenosis may be acquired in adults with chronic antral gastritis or peptic ulcers near the pylorus. Other causes of acquired pyloric stenosis include gastric carcinomas, lymphomas, and adjacent carcinomas of the pancreas.</li>
                <li><strong>Gastritis:</strong> Inflammation of the gastric mucosa. The inflammation may be predominantly acute, with neutrophilic infiltration, or chronic, with a predominance of lymphocytes and plasma cells.</li>
                <li><strong>Ulcer:</strong> A disruption of the mucosa extending through the muscularis mucosa into the submucosa or deeper. Ulcers may occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract but are seen most often in the stomach and duodenum, associated with peptic ulcer disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Peptic ulcer disease:</strong> Peptic ulcers are chronic, usually solitary lesions of the gastrointestinal mucosa caused by the action of acid-peptic juices. Both acid and pepsin are necessary for peptic ulcer disease to develop.</li>
                <li><strong>Hypertrophic gastropathy:</strong> A group of uncommon conditions characterized by enlargement of the rugal folds of the gastric mucosa caused by hyperplasia of the mucosal epithelial cells. The three variants are (1) Ménétrier disease with marked hyperplasia of the surface mucous cells with atrophy of the gastric glands that may lead to severe loss of plasma proteins, (2) Zollinger-Ellison syndrome with gastric gland hyperplasia secondary to excessive gastrin secretion by a tumor (gastrinoma), and (3) hypertrophic-hypersecretory gastropathy with hyperplasia of the parietal and chief cells within the gastric glands. These three conditions may mimic gastric cancer on radiographic studies. The excessive amount of acid secretion in the second and third conditions predisposes patients to peptic ulceration.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <h4>Normal Stomach</h4>
            <p>The stomach is divided into four anatomic regions: the cardia, fundus, body or corpus, and antrum. The pyloric sphincter demarcates the antrum from the duodenum. Infoldings of mucosa and submucosa, or rugae, extend longitudinally and are most prominent in the proximal stomach. Several types of cells are found in the stomach: parietal cells produce gastric hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor involved in the absorption of vitamin B12, chief cells secrete the proteolytic enzymes pepsinogen I and II, surface and mucous neck cells secrete mucus involved in the protection of the mucosa from gastric acid, and G cells found in the antral, pyloric, and duodenal mucosa produce gastrin.</p>
            <p>The secretion of gastric acid is proportional to the total number of parietal cells in the glands of the body and fundus of the stomach. The secretory process may be divided into three phases: cephalic, gastric, and intestinal. Gastrin, which is released in response to vagal stimulation, is the most important mediator of gastric acid secretion. Histamine also stimulates acid secretion. Thus, surgical interruption of vagal stimulation and inhibition of histamine stimulation by blocking the H2 receptor on the parietal cell membrane are effective maneuvers for reducing gastric acid production. Several factors act together to protect the stomach from digestion by gastric acid. Mucus secretion, bicarbonate secretion, the epithelial barrier formed by tight intercellular junctions, a rich mucosal blood flow that removes back-diffused acid, and reflex vasodilation in response to toxins or acid breach of the epithelial layer all contribute to the mucosal barrier.</p>
            <h4>Gastritis</h4>
            <p>Inflammation of the gastric mucosa occurs in a variety of clinical situations and may be acute or chronic. Acute gastritis varies in severity; it may be asymptomatic, cause epigastric pain with nausea and vomiting, or present with massive hematemesis. Acute erosive gastritis is an important cause of acute gastrointestinal bleeding. In chronic gastritis, there are chronic mucosal inflammatory changes, usually without erosions, that may lead to mucosal atrophy and dysplastic epithelium, predisposing the patient to the development of carcinoma.</p>

            </table>
            <p>Most cases of chronic gastritis are thought to be associated with chronic H. pylori infection. Chronic gastritis that results from H. pylori infection most often involves the antrum and is not associated with pernicious anemia. Most patients improve with antibiotic treatment, and relapses of chronic gastritis are associated with a recurrence of infection. Patients are at risk for developing peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer, including adenocarcinoma and lymphoma.</p>
            <p>Patients with autoimmune gastritis (diffuse atrophic gastritis) may have nausea, vomiting, and upper abdominal pain. Patients usually have autoantibodies to gastric parietal cells or intrinsic factor. Destruction of gastric glands of the fundus leads to loss of acid production (achlorhydria) and hypergastrinemia. Loss of intrinsic factor leads to pernicious anemia. Thus, patients with autoimmune gastritis may initially present with peripheral neuropathy symptoms from B12 deficiency in addition to their abdominal symptoms. Patients may also have other autoimmune disorders, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis or Addison disease.</p>

            <h4>Peptic Ulcer Disease</h4>
            <p>Peptic ulcers are usually solitary, arising from exposure of the mucosal epithelium to acid-peptic secretions. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) occurs most often in middle-aged to older adults. The most common anatomic sites are the duodenum and the stomach, in a ratio of 4:1. Helicobacter pylori infection is present in virtually all patients with duodenal ulcers and 70 percent of patients with PUD involving the stomach. Helicobacter pylori can cause damage by (1) secreting urease, protease, and phospholipases, (2) attracting neutrophils that release myeloperoxidase, and (3) promoting thrombotic occlusion of capillaries, leading to ischemic damage of the epithelium. Complications of PUD include anemia, hemorrhage, perforation, and obstruction. Malignant transformation is rare and is related to underlying chronic gastritis.</p>

            <h4>Gastric Cancer</h4>
            <p>Most (90 to 95 percent) gastric malignancies are adenocarcinomas, with a smaller number of lymphomas, carcinoids, and spindle cell tumors. Although the incidence of gastric carcinoma has been decreasing in Western countries over the last 50 years, the prognosis is still poor, with a 20 percent 5-year survival. Risk factors for gastric carcinoma include nitrates; smoked, salted, or pickled foods; lack of fresh fruits and vegetables; chronic atrophic gastritis; H. pylori infection; partial gastrectomy; gastric adenomas; blood group A; and close relatives with gastric cancer. Two types of gastric carcinoma are recognized: the intestinal type and the diffuse type.</p>

            <h3>Answers</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>A.</strong> Chronic atropic gastritis often is associated with autoantibodies to parietal cells. Loss of these cells leads to decreased gastric acid (hypochlorhydria) and decreased intrinsic factor. Lack of intrinsic factor results in deceased or absent vitamin B12 absorption (pernicious anemia).</li>
                <li><strong>E.</strong> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome refers to gastric gland hyperplasia secondary to excessive gastrin secretion by a tumor (gastrinoma), usually found in the pancreas. The excess gastrin increases the thickness of the gastric mucosa and increases the acid production by the stomach. This results in the formation of recurrent peptic ulcers, especially within the duodenum and jejunum. As a result, the classic clinical triad associated with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is the combination of increased acid production by the stomach, peptic ulcers of the duodenum and jejunum, and an islet-cell tumor of the pancreas.</li>
                <li><strong>B.</strong> The findings suggest that the patient’s gastric cancer has metastasized to the ovaries; this is known as a Krukenberg tumor. Histology typically shows “signet ring cells.”</li>

            <h3>Answers to Case 3: Hepatitis</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 57-year-old man with a prior history of blood transfusion presents with jaundice and ascites, along with mildly elevated transaminases as well as evidence of impaired hepatic synthetic function (hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathy).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis.</li>
                <li><strong>Possible etiologies of this disorder:</strong> Most commonly caused by chronic toxin exposure (alcohol) or chronic viral infection; sometimes chronic hepatitis may be caused by inherited metabolic disorders such as hemochromatosis.</li>
                <li><strong>Other appropriate tests:</strong> Hepatitis virus serologies and possibly a liver biopsy.</li>
                <li><strong>Possible complications:</strong> Hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatocellular carcinoma.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
            <p>This patient had a blood transfusion in the early 1980s, before the discovery of and the institution of screening for hepatitis C virus. He had a long asymptomatic period and now has signs of advanced liver disease. His firm nodular liver probably represents cirrhosis, with scarring of the liver parenchyma along with regenerative nodules. His transaminases (ALT and AST) are only mildly elevated but these tests may be within normal limits, particularly early in the course of disease. The fact that he has impaired hepatic synthesis of albumin and coagulation factors indicates that he has very advanced disease, especially in light of the enormous reserve and regenerative capacity of the liver. The accumulation of ascitic fluid in the peritoneum usually represents portal hypertension, an increase in pressure in the portal venous system that typically results from increased intrahepatic resistance to portal blood flow because of perisinusoidal deposition of collagen.</p>
            <h3>Approach to Liver Pathology</h3>
            <h4>Objectives</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Know the differences between the viral hepatitis subgroups.</li>
                <li>Describe the serology markers used to diagnose viral hepatitis infection.</li>
                <li>Describe the nonviral causes of chronic hepatitis.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Definitions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cirrhosis:</strong> Although often used as a clinical description, cirrhosis is really a pathologic diagnosis that is characterized by disruption of normal liver architecture by interconnecting fibrous scars and the creation of parenchymal nodules by regenerative activity and the network of scars. This pathologic process can be thought of as the final common pathway of many causes of chronic hepatic injury. The inciting factor causes hepatocyte necrosis and deposition of collagen. At some point the fibrosis becomes irreversible, and cirrhosis then develops. Cirrhosis can be classified according to morphologic features (micronodular, most often caused by alcohol, or macronodular, most often resulting from viral hepatitis) or according to the etiology: alcoholic, cardiac, biliary, or drug induced. However, a single cause of hepatic injury can produce a variety of pathologic patterns, and any given morphology can result from a variety of causes.</li>
                <li><strong>Acute hepatitis:</strong> The influx of acute inflammatory cells, which may follow or precede hepatocyte necrosis. The morphologic changes in both acute and chronic hepatitis are common to the hepatitis viruses and can be mimicked by drug reactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Chronic hepatitis:</strong> It can be due to numerous causes, all of which result in hepatic inflammation and necrosis for at least 6 months, but without the nodular regeneration and architectural distortion of cirrhosis.</li>
                <li><strong>Hepatic steatosis:</strong> Also known as “fatty liver,” this entity commonly is due to alcohol ingestion but also can be due to many other causes of altered lipid metabolism (diabetes, obesity, glucocorticoid use, total parenteral nutrition, some drug reactions), resulting in the accumulation of fat first in cytoplasmic microvesicles in the hepatocyte. Later, the vacuoles coalesce into macrovesicles, compressing and displacing the nucleus so that the hepatocyte resembles a lipocyte. Grossly, the liver becomes enlarged with a yellow, greasy appearance. Steatosis is usually reversible with discontinuation of the underlying cause, but it may lead to the development of fibrosis around the central veins and sinusoids and ultimately to cirrhosis.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <h4>Normal Anatomy and Function</h4>
            <p>The liver receives two-thirds of its blood supply from the portal vein and one-third from the hepatic artery, and its venous drainage via the hepatic vein flows into the inferior vena cava. Its microarchitecture is arranged around this vascular supply and the biliary ducts, which join to form the hepatic duct, which leads to the common bile duct and into the duodenum. The liver is organized into 1- to 2-mm hexagonal lobules, with cords or plates of hepatocytes radiating out from the central vein, the terminal venules of the hepatic vein. At each corner of the hexagon are the portal tracts, composed of the terminal branches of the portal vein and the hepatic artery, as well as the bile duct. Arterial and portal venous blood flows through sinusoids, between the cords of hepatocytes, giving them a rich vascular supply (25 percent of cardiac output) before draining into the central vein. Bile is secreted into bile canaliculi between adjacent hepatocytes and flows into the canals of Herring and then to the lobular bile ducts.</p>
            <p>The liver serves many functions, including maintenance of carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism; synthesis of nearly all serum proteins; and detoxification and excretion of noxious substances in the bile. One such substance is bilirubin, a waste product that is the metabolite of the breakdown of heme from senescent red blood cells. In its initial form, unconjugated or “indirect” bilirubin, it is insoluble in aqueous solution, circulates highly bound to albumin, and is toxic to tissues. It undergoes conjugation with glucuronic acid in the hepatocyte to form conjugated or direct bilirubin, which is water-soluble and nontoxic, and then is excreted into the bile canaliculus. When liver disease causes jaundice, affected individuals usually have reflux of conjugated bilirubin into the blood, which causes the visible icterus when deposited in tissues, as well as the dark urine resulting from urinary excretion of elevated levels of water-soluble conjugated bilirubin.</p>
            <p><strong>Figure 3-1:</strong> Microscopic image of liver cirrhosis.</p>
            <h4>Approach to Viral Hepatitis</h4>
            <p>Because of its rich vascular supply, the liver may be involved in any systemic blood-borne infection, but the most common and clinically significant infections are those with one of five hepatotropic viruses: hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. Each virus can produce virtually indistinguishable clinical syndromes. Affected individuals often present with a prodrome of nonspecific constitutional symptoms, including fever, nausea, fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, headache, and sometimes pharyngitis and coryza. This is followed by the onset of visible jaundice caused by hyperbilirubinemia, tenderness and enlargement of the liver, and dark urine caused by bilirubinuria. The clinical course, outcomes, and possible complications vary with the type of virus causing the hepatitis.</p>

            <p>Hepatitis A and hepatitis E are very contagious and are transmitted by the fecal-oral route, usually by contaminated food or water in areas where sanitation is poor, and in day-care situations by children. Hepatitis A is found worldwide and is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis in the United States. Hepatitis E is much less common and is found in Asia, Africa, and Central America. Both hepatitis A and hepatitis E infections usually lead to self-limited illnesses and generally resolve within weeks. Almost all patients with hepatitis A recover completely and have no long-term complications. Most patients with hepatitis E also have uncomplicated courses, but some patients, particularly pregnant women, have been reported to develop severe hepatic necrosis and fatal liver failure.</p>
            <p>Hepatitis B is the second most common type of viral hepatitis in the United States, and it is usually sexually transmitted. It also may be acquired parenterally, for example, through intravenous drug use, and during birth, from chronically infected mothers. The outcome then depends on the age at which the infection was acquired. Up to 90 percent of infected newborns develop chronic hepatitis B infection, which places an affected infant at significant risk of hepatocellular carcinoma later in adulthood. Among individuals infected later in life, approximately 95 percent recover completely without sequelae. Between 5 and 10 percent of patients will develop chronic hepatitis and may progress to cirrhosis. Also, a chronic carrier state may be seen in which the virus continues to replicate but does not cause hepatic damage in the host.</p>
            <p>Hepatitis C is transmitted parenterally by blood transfusions or intravenous drug use and rarely by sexual contact. It uncommonly is diagnosed as a cause of acute hepatitis, often producing subclinical infection, but frequently is diagnosed later as a cause of chronic hepatitis. The natural history of infection is not completely understood, but 50 to 85 percent of patients with hepatitis C will develop chronic infection.</p>
            <p>Hepatitis D is a defective RNA virus that requires the presence of the hepatitis B virus to replicate. It can be acquired as a coinfection simultaneously with acute hepatitis B or as a later superinfection in a person with a chronic hepatitis B infection. Patients with chronic hepatitis B virus who then become infected with hepatitis D may suffer clinical deterioration; in 10 to 20 percent of these cases, the infected individuals develop severe fatal hepatic failure.</p>
            <h4>Hepatitis Serologies</h4>
            <p>Clinical presentation does not reliably establish the viral etiology, and so serologic studies are used to establish a diagnosis. Anti-hepatitis A immunoglobulin M (IgM) establishes an acute hepatitis A infection. If anti-hepatitis C antibody is present, acute hepatitis C is diagnosed, but the test may be negative for several months. The hepatitis C polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, which becomes positive earlier in the disease course, often aids in the diagnosis. Acute hepatitis B infection is diagnosed by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in the clinical context of elevated serum transaminase levels and jaundice. HBsAg later disappears when the antibody (anti-HBs) is produced.</p>
            <p>There is often an interval of a few weeks between the disappearance of HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBsAb, which is referred to as the window period. During this interval, the presence of anti-hepatitis B core antigen IgM (anti-HBc IgM) will indicate an acute hepatitis B infection. Hepatitis B pre-core antigen (HBeAg) represents a high level of viral replication. It is almost always present during acute infection, but its persistence after 6 weeks of illness is a sign of chronic infection and high infectivity. Persistence of HBsAg or HBeAg is a marker for chronic hepatitis or a chronic carrier state; elevated or normal serum transaminase levels distinguish these two entities.</p>

            <h4>Pathologic Changes in Hepatitis</h4>
            <p>As was mentioned before, the pathologic findings in acute hepatitis can be caused by various insults, such as viral infection and toxic injury, and are not pathognomic for any particular cause. There may be hepatocyte swelling called ballooning degeneration, as well as liver cell necrosis, including fragmentation and condensation of hepatocytes, forming intensely eosinophilic Councilman bodies, which are characteristic of viral hepatitis. Formation of ropelike eosinophilic structures within hepatocytes, called Mallory bodies, is typical of alcoholic hepatitis. Another finding in acute hepatitis is an inflammatory infiltrate in the portal tracts.</p>
            <p>Chronic hepatitis C is characterized by the formation of lymphoid aggregates in the portal tracts as well as fatty changes in hepatocytes. Ground glass cells often are seen in chronic hepatitis B. If inflammation is limited to the portal tracts, the disease is milder and the prognosis is better. When it spills over into the periportal parenchyma, destroying the limiting plate (piecemeal necrosis) or extending across lobules, such as the portal area to the central vein, which is termed bridging necrosis, the disease is more progressive and the prognosis is poorer.</p>
            <h4>Complications of Chronic Hepatitis</h4>
            <p>Many patients with chronic hepatitis have stable disease, but a significant fraction develops ongoing fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis, as was described previously. As a result of the loss of functioning hepatic mass, patients have impaired synthesis of albumin and consequent edema, as well as diminished production of coagulation factors, leading to a coagulopathy. The fibrosis causes increased intrahepatic resistance to portal venous blood flow and thus increased pressure in this venous system. Portal hypertension in turn leads to the development of ascites, or the accumulation of intraperitoneal fluid, and the formation of collateral venous circulation, such as esophageal varices, which often produce life-threatening hemorrhages. Finally, patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis of almost any cause, especially hepatitis B or hepatitis C, are at increased risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma.</p>
            <h4>Approach to Toxic Liver Disease</h4>
            <h5>Alcoholic Liver Disease</h5>
            <p>Alcohol-related liver disease occurs in three overlapping forms: hepatic steatosis (fatty liver), alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. The pathologic features of these conditions were described previously. The major points to note here are that fat begins to accumulate within hepatocytes after even a moderate intake of alcohol and, with continued exposure, continues to accumulate until the liver may be 3 to 4 times its normal mass. Up to the point where fibrosis appears, the fatty change is reversible with abstention from alcohol. Alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by acute hepatocyte necrosis, particularly after bouts of heavy drinking, and is usually reversible. It typically includes some sinusoidal and perivenular fibrosis and, if superimposed on fatty liver, often progresses to cirrhosis. Patients with alcoholic hepatitis often have an AST/ALT ratio greater than 2.</p>
            <h5>Acetaminophen Toxicity</h5>
            <p>A relatively common and treatable form of hepatotoxic exposure that otherwise may lead to hepatic failure and death is acetaminophen poisoning. A minor metabolite of acetaminophen is produced by cytochrome P-450 2E1 in the form of a hepatotoxin, which normally is detoxified by binding to glutathione. Hepatotoxicity is most likely to develop in patients with single very large ingestions (such as suicide attempts) or patients with enhanced activity of this cytochrome, as well as those with depleted levels of glutathione, such as chronic alcoholics. Blood levels of acetaminophen correlate with the severity of hepatic injury. Patients with toxic levels of acetaminophen may be treated with doses of N-acetylcysteine, which replaces glutathione stores, allowing detoxification of the metabolite.</p>
            <h4>Approach to Metabolic Disorders</h4>
            <h5>Hemochromatosis</h5>
            <p>Hereditary hemochromatosis, a disorder caused by the inheritance of a mutant HFE gene, is a common disorder of iron storage that most often is found in persons of northern European descent. The disease classically was referred to as bronze diabetes because of the deposition of iron causing skin pigmentation, diabetes, as well as micronodular cirrhosis, with increased levels of ferritin and hemosiderin within hepatocytes. It now can be diagnosed before the occurrence of end-organ damage resulting from iron deposition by screening for transferrin saturation greater than 45 percent and confirmed by HFE genotyping.</p>
            <h5>α1-Antitrypsin Deficiency</h5>
            <p>α1-Antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is an inherited disorder in which there is an abnormally low level of this serum protease inhibitor. In some patients, the abnormal A1AT is synthesized in the liver but cannot be secreted, and so it accumulates in cytoplasmic globules. The spectrum of liver diseases ranges from neonatal hepatitis, to childhood cirrhosis, to adult cirrhosis. Thus, patients with A1AT deficiency will often develop emphysema due to increased levels of elastase in the lungs in addition to cirrhosis. Diagnosis is achieved by finding low levels of serum A1AT activity and by A1AT phenotyping.</p>
            <h5>Wilson Disease</h5>
            <p>Wilson disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism in which there is accumulation of copper in multiple tissues, including liver, brain, and eye. Clinical manifestations may include acute or chronic hepatitis, fatty liver, and cirrhosis, along with extrapyramidal movement disorders or psychiatric disturbances. Diagnosis is made by finding Kayser-Fleischer rings in the cornea, which are pathognomonic, or by low levels of serum ceruloplasmin (a serum copper-transport protein), as well as increased levels of hepatic or urinary copper.</p>

            <h3>Answers</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>A.</strong> Acute hepatitis B infection is characterized by the presence or shedding of HbsAg, followed by a rise in anti-Hbc IgM. Adult infection has a much better prognosis (only 5 to 10 percent of patients develop chronic hepatitis) compared with perinatal infection (more than 90 percent develop chronic infection). Councilman bodies can be seen in viral hepatitis; Mallory bodies are characteristic of alcoholic hepatitis.</li>
                <li><strong>D.</strong> The pathologic findings of acute hepatitis are nonspecific. The distinguishing feature in this case is the presence of hemiballism, an extrapyramidal movement disorder, suggesting Wilson disease. Kayser-Fleischer rings are green to brown deposits of copper in the Descemet membrane near the corneal limbus and are diagnostic.</li>
                <li><strong>A.</strong> Councilman bodies are intensely eosinophilic bodies that may be seen in liver biopsy specimens from individuals with viral hepatitis. These Councilman bodies are in fact necrotic hepatocytes that have undergone T-cell induced apoptosis. These apoptotic cells are cleared rapidly, and there may not be as many present in a liver biopsy specimen as were originally present.</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Answers to Case 4: Colon Adenoma</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 45-year-old man with a family history of colon cancer underwent colonoscopy for rectal bleeding. Colonoscopic findings included several small pedunculated polyps in the right colon, all measuring less than 5 mm.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Hyperplastic polyps or tubular adenomas.</li>
                <li><strong>Syndromes predisposing to colon cancer:</strong> Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) are two common inherited colon cancer syndromes.</li>
                <li><strong>Dietary factors that play a role in the development of colon cancer:</strong> Diets rich in fat and red meat and low in fiber may contribute to the development of colon cancer.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
            <p>Colon cancer is the third most common malignant neoplasm worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The peak incidence is in the seventh decade of life. Recommended screening for colon cancer for patients without increased risk starts at age 50, but for at-risk patients with a positive family history, screening should start at age 40 (some recommend 10 years earlier than the age at which the youngest index case presents). Annual fecal occult blood tests should be performed as well as digital rectal examination and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years. Additional screening can be done by colonoscopy every 10 years, or a double-contrast barium enema can be done every 5 to 10 years. These recommended screening intervals may be maintained after a negative examination. For patients at high risk for cancer or with polyps, rescreening by colonoscopy at 3-year intervals is recommended. New technologies such as virtual colonography and genetic testing of stool specimens are being examined for their appropriate clinical settings. In this patient, the colonic polyps showed proliferation of tubular glands, arising from a fibromuscular base with normal colonic epithelium consistent with a polyp stalk. The polyps showed no evidence of malignant transformation (i.e., carcinoma). The diagnosis was multiple tubular adenomas of the colon.</p>

                <li><strong>Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer:</strong> Also known as Lynch syndrome. Often presents as right-sided colon cancer and involves mutation in mismatch repair genes. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and affected individuals are also at high risk for extracolonic malignancies such as endometrial carcinomas.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <p>Polyps of the colon can be classified broadly into inflammatory/reactive, hyperplastic, and neoplastic. Inflammatory polyps can be seen in chronic colitides such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. Hyperplastic polyps are some of the more frequently encountered polyps and are thought to represent nonneoplastic proliferation of colonic epithelium. There is accumulating evidence that some hyperplastic polyps may transform to adenomas through a serrated adenoma pathway. Adenomas are truly neoplastic proliferations and have the potential to transform and progress to carcinomas.</p>
            <p><strong>Figure 4-1:</strong> Colonic polyp: gross pictograph.</p>
            <h4>Types of Adenomas</h4>
            <p>Adenomas can be classified on the basis of the pattern of growth: whether they are flat, sessile, and broad without a stalk, or pedunculated and on a stalk. Histologically, depending on the extent of tubular gland formation versus fingerlike villous projections, they are classified as tubular adenomas, villous adenomas, or tubulovillous adenomas.</p>
            <h4>Polyposis and Inherited Colon Cancer Syndromes</h4>
            <p>Syndromes that involve the formation of multiple gastrointestinal polyps occur infrequently. Some, such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and Cowden disease, are autosomal dominant, resulting in the formation of nonneoplastic hamartomatous polyps; others, such as Canada-Cronkhite syndrome, are not hereditary and result in multiple juvenile polyps. Other clinically significant polyposis or colon cancer syndromes include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.</p>
            <p>The autosomal dominant FAP gene on chromosome 5q21 contains the tumor suppressor gene APC (adenomatous polyposis coli). Affected individuals have hundreds to thousands of polyps, typically presenting in the left colon. Almost all individuals with APC gene mutations eventually develop colon cancer. Hence, carriers usually are candidates for prophylactic colectomy. Recent studies have shown that cyclooxygenase inhibitors can suppress polyp formation and possibly carcinoma development in patients with FAP.</p>
            <h4>Adenoma-Dysplasia-Carcinoma Sequence</h4>
            <p>A variant of FAP is Gardner syndrome, which involves the formation of osteomas of the bone, desmoid fibromatosis. HNPCC also is known as Lynch syndrome, named after the gastroenterologist Dr. Henry Lynch. The autosomal dominant inherited disease presents early in life, often with right-sided cancer, and can be associated with polyps, although much less numerous (usually fewer than 10) than what is seen in FAP. Patients with HNPCC are also at risk for extra–gastrointestinal tract tumors.</p>
            <p>There are also less-well-defined familial cancer syndromes involving glandular elements (adenocarcinomas) that are associated with a family history or personal history of breast, ovarian, endometrial, or colon cancer.</p>
            <p>The development of colon cancer is a multifactorial process involving not only predisposition genes but also factors such as diet (low-fiber foods, red meat, and refined carbohydrates are nonfavorable), obesity, and inactivity. Genetically, it is known that adenomas can progress and transform through additional mutations (i.e., genetic “hits”) and progressively grow in size, increase in the degree of dysplasia, and acquire full malignant potential (carcinoma). Additional genes that have been shown to be involved in this process include the K-ras oncogene, the DCC (deleted in colon cancer) adhesion molecule gene, and the p53 tumor suppressor gene.</p>

                <li><strong>A.</strong> Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma, also known as Lynch syndrome, presents as an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the formation of colon cancer, usually early in life. The disorder is associated with the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer gene and with the formation of multiple colonic polyps, although fewer than seen in the family adenomatous polyposis syndrome.</li>
                <li><strong>D.</strong> The presence of dysplastic epithelium within a colonic polyp defines adenomas of the colon, the three types of which are tubular adenomas, mixed tubulovillous (villoglandular) adenomas, and villous adenomas. Tubular adenomas are the smallest adenomatous polyps of the colon and have the least malignant potential. Microscopically these polyps are composed of dysplastic epithelium that forms tubules and glandular structures. If abundant finger-like (papillary) structures are present, then the polyp is classified as villous adenomas. These polyps are the largest types of colonic adenomas and have the greatest malignant potential.</li>

            <h3>Answers to Case 5: Pancreatic Carcinoma</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 57-year-old man has severe upper abdominal pain radiating to his midback, fatigue, loss of appetite, and generalized jaundice. A large mass in the head and body of the pancreas is noted on CT imaging.</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Likely prognosis of this condition:</strong> Poor prognosis with 5-year survival less than 5 percent</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
            <p>The vast majority of pancreatic carcinomas involve exocrine glands and are known as adenocarcinomas. The etiology is largely unknown. However, point mutations of the K-ras gene have been observed in over 90 percent of the pancreatic tumors, suggesting abnormalities at the genetic level. Pain and nonspecific systemic symptoms such as weakness and weight loss are the usual first signs of malignancy. Obstructive jaundice is seen commonly because of the preference for tumors to occur in the head of the pancreas. The symptomatic course of pancreatic carcinoma is typically brief and progressive. Radiologic workups, including abdominal CT and ultrasound, are diagnostic for the cancer and are used for staging. No specific biological tests are available for screening or early detection. Cancer of the pancreas is now the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States. The median survival period from the time of diagnosis to demise is arguably the worst of any of the cancers. The median survival for untreated advanced cases is approximately 3.5 months; with good treatment this increases to approximately 6 months. The 5-year relative survival rate of patients with this cancer is only 3 to 5 percent. Even though a Whipple operation is considered the treatment of choice for localized and early disease, fewer than 15 percent of pancreatic tumors overall are resectable at the time of diagnosis. The prognosis of pancreatic carcinoma is one of the most dismal among any malignancies ever known.</p>

            </ul>
            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <h4>Normal Pancreatic Histology</h4>
            <p>The pancreas is a small, spongy gland that lies just under the curvature of the stomach and deep within the abdomen. The majority of the pancreas is composed of exocrine glands, which produce enzymes necessary for food digestion. The secretions from acinar cells, the structural unit throughout the pancreas, containing salts and enzymes, are called pancreatic fluid, which eventually drains into the pancreatic duct. The pancreatic duct usually joins the bile duct and empties its combined digestive contents into the duodenum. Additionally, the pancreas has an endocrine, or hormonal, function. Inside specialized groupings of cells called the islets of Langerhans, the pancreas produces hormones such as insulin and glucagons, among other hormones. These molecules are secreted directly into the bloodstream, eliciting numerous biologic effects throughout the body.</p>
            <h4>Epidemiology</h4>
            <p>Each year approximately 30,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Most of them will have passed away by the end of the first year. Most patients are between the ages of 60 and 80. Men tend to be affected more often than women. The median survival period from the time of diagnosis until demise is extremely short, with a mean of 3.5 months. It has been approximated that approximately 30 percent of the changes that initiate cancer of the pancreas are caused by smoking and that approximately 8 percent are “secondary” to a hereditary genetic predisposition. There does not appear to be a strong correlation between the onset of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and the drinking of alcohol or coffee.</p>
            <h4>Biochemical Tests</h4>
            <p>Laboratory results often reveal nonspecific elevated bilirubin and elevated liver function enzymes as a result of biliary obstruction. The CA 19-9 marker, a Lewis blood group–related mucin, frequently is elevated in adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, but its use in screening for or diagnosis of the cancer is not accepted in general practice. High CA 19-9 levels may be associated with but do not always indicate larger tumors and with a decreased likelihood of surgical resectability. The use of this marker is accepted more widely as a running measure in a particular individual to help reflect the stability or progression of the cancer. Point mutation of K-ras is observed in 90 percent of pancreatic cancer patients. However, the utility of a screening test for K-ras mutation is not proven clinically.</p>
            <h4>Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas</h4>
            <p>In up to 95 percent of cases, pancreatic cancer arises from the exocrine portion of the organ. Most of the exocrine tumors (approximately 90 percent) are from ductal cells—those which line the pancreatic ducts. Further, under the microscope, the appearance and arrangement of these carcinoma cells can appear duct like (or “adeno”), giving the term adenocarcinoma to this most common form of pancreatic cancer. Approximately three-quarters of exocrine tumors of the pancreas arise in the head and neck of the pancreas. It is believed that cancer is caused by the mutations of a gene, which confer increased abnormal growth potential to cells. Among other abnormalities, an oncogene called K-ras is found to be altered in up to 95 percent of ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. The Whipple operation (pancreaticoduodenectomy) typically is performed in patients with tumors localized in the head of the pancreas.</p>
            <h4>Other Malignant Tumors of the Pancreas</h4>
            <p>Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas (islet-cell tumors) are much less common than tumors arising from the exocrine pancreas. Approximately 75 percent of these tumors are “functioning,” meaning that they are found to be producing symptoms related to one or more of the hormone peptides they secrete. The predominant peptide secreted gives the functioning islet-cell tumor its name. The hormones produced by neuroendocrine tumors include insulin, gastrin, glucagon, somatostatin, neurotensin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), among others. Typically, the symptoms produced by the excess secretion of the predominant hormone in a functioning endocrine tumor lead to the eventual diagnosis. It is not possible to determine malignancy from the histologic appearance. Malignancy is determined by finding additional metastatic sites. The natural history of neuroendocrine carcinoma tends to be favorable compared with that of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. For example, the median survival duration from the time of diagnosis for patients with nonfunctioning metastatic neuroendocrine tumors approaches 5 years. Immediate treatment of the symptomatic conditions created by the oversecretion of the hormone may be appropriate. Surgery is generally curative.</p>

                <li><strong>A.</strong> Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of pancreatic malignancy arising from the pancreatic ducts. In contrast, squamous cell carcinomas usually originate from stratified squamous epithelium, such as the esophagus. Clear cell carcinomas can be found in the kidneys, and signet cell carcinomas can be found in the stomach. A medullary carcinoma is a type of carcinoma of the thyroid gland.</li>
                <li><strong>B.</strong> CA 19-9 is currently the best available tumor marker used clinically to look for possible recurrence of pancreatic cancer after surgery. Other markers have been studied in patients with pancreatic cancer, including CA-50, SPAN-1, and DUPAN-1, but these markers have not been as useful as CA 19-9. In contrast, CA-125 is associated with ovarian cancer, whereas CA 15-3 and CA 27-29 are associated with breast cancer, particularly advanced breast cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>C.</strong> Elevated serum levels of insulin that result in hypoglycemia can be caused by a tumor that secretes insulin; an insulinoma is a type of islet cell tumor of the pancreas. In contrast, carcinoid tumors, which are found in the appendix and small intestine, may secrete vasoactive substances such as serotonin. A microcystic adenoma is a rare type of benign tumor of the pancreas, and a tubulovillous adenoma is a type of neoplastic polyp of the colon.</li>

            <h3>Answers to Case 6: Crohn Disease</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 22-year-old woman has a 2-year history of recurrent diarrhea, abdominal pain, slight fever, joint pain, and red skin lesions. Colonoscopy reveals several sharply delineated areas with thickening of the bowel wall and mucosal ulceration, which on biopsy show full-thickness inflammation of the bowel wall and several noncaseating granulomas.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Crohn disease</li>
                <li><strong>Common complications of this disease:</strong> Malabsorption and malnutrition, fibrous strictures of the intestine, and fistulae to other organs, such as from bowel to skin or bowel to bladder</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
            <p>The patient’s presentation is very characteristic for inflammatory bowel disease, that is, a several-year history of diarrhea and abdominal pain. Additionally, the colonoscopy revealing full-thickness inflammation with noncaseating granulomas is consistent with Crohn disease. Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory condition that is ubiquitous in its distribution in the gastrointestinal tract. It most commonly manifests in the small intestine, in particular the terminal ileum. The disease exhibits aggressive activity of the gastrointestinal immune system, but the exact cause is unknown. Published studies in the United States report incidence rates that vary between 1.2 and 8.8 per 100,000 population; the prevalence is 44 to 106 per 100,000. The condition is more common in the cold climates of the northeastern United States than in the south. Those of Jewish ethnicity have a high incidence. The disorder, which is slightly more common in females, has a bimodal age distribution, peaking in the early twenties and again emerging in the mid-sixties. Theories regarding pathogenesis have referred to genetics, infection, autoimmune or allergic processes, thromboembolic disorders, and dietary disorders.</p>
            <h3>Approach to Inflammatory Bowel Disease</h3>
            <h4>Objectives</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Describe the differences between ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease.</li>
                <li>Describe the comorbidities of inflammatory bowel disease.</li>
                <li>Describe the future risk of developing cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <p>The predominant symptoms of Crohn disease are diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. These symptoms may be widely variable, depending on the distribution of the inflammatory lesions in the patient’s intestines. The principal stimulus for diarrhea is the mucosal immune response in association with cytokine release. If the colon is involved, diarrhea may be more marked and tenesmus may occur. Abdominal pain may be due to local inflammation or obstruction if it is experienced in the central abdomen or right lower quadrant. Abscesses or fistulae also may produce pain. Secondary causes of abdominal pain in relation to Crohn disease are gallstones and renal colic. Malabsorption leading to weight loss and failure to thrive may occur in children. Fat, protein, mineral, and vitamin deficiencies may be associated with extensive or recurrent disease. About one-third of patients develop perineal symptoms or signs such as anal fistulae or fissures.</p>
            <p>Nongastrointestinal symptoms of Crohn disease involve the skin, joints, or eyes. Skin lesions include erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosa, aphthous stomatitis, and finger clubbing. The rheumatologic manifestations often present as a large joint polyarthropathy resembling ankylosing spondylitis or a small joint fleeting polyarthropathy that is like rheumatoid arthritis. The human lymphocyte antigen B-27 (HLA-B27) may be present. Inflammatory eye lesions are confined to the anterior chamber, such as uveitis, iritis, episcleritis, and conjunctivitis. A chronic active hepatitis may develop; more seriously, sclerosing cholangitis can progress to cirrhosis. There is a predisposition to gallstones when terminal ileal disease is present.</p>
            <h4>Physical Examination</h4>
            <p>Physical examination may reveal a nutritional deficiency. The extraintestinal manifestations may be apparent. Abdominal examination may suggest partial bowel obstruction, inflammatory mass, focal areas of tenderness, or enterocutaneous fistulae. Perineal examination may reveal fistulae or abscesses. Perianal skin tags with bluish discoloration may be present. On rectal examination there may be a stricture, a palpable ulcer, or perirectal abscesses. Bloody diarrhea may be detectable. Clinical features compatible with anemia or hypoalbuminemia may be present. Hypoalbuminemia may manifest with peripheral edema.</p>
            <h4>Approach</h4>
            <p>Plain abdominal radiographs provide important information in the acute presentation of symptoms, as they may demonstrate intestinal obstruction or evidence of perforation. Biliary or renal calculi, arthropathy, or osteoporosis also may be detected. Endoscopy of the lower and upper gastrointestinal tract is used to identify disease and provide biopsy evidence. Barium follow-through examination or small bowel enteroclysis may demonstrate discrete lesions in the small intestine. Fistulograms are helpful to surgeons by providing information about the site of the fistula and the presence of obstruction or abscess cavity in association with it.</p>
            <p>Computerized tomography is the mainstay in terms of providing information about thickened loops of bowel, abscesses, and fistulous tracts. Magnetic resonance imaging, including cholangiography, may be helpful. Ultrasound may reveal thickened terminal ileum, abscesses, and evidence of biliary tract disease. Ultrasound examination of the renal tract may reveal obstruction or stone formation. Endoscopic ultrasound may be useful in assessing bowel wall involvement and the extent of the disease process. Studies of bone density may be required.</p>
            <p>Endoscopy allows detailed examination of the mucosa of the upper and lower intestines, with the added advantage of allowing biopsies of abnormal areas to be taken. Capsule endoscopy is an innovation that permits detailed photography of the small intestinal lumen. There may be electrolyte abnormalities in Crohn disease. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) frequently is elevated above 30 mm/h, and the serum vitamin B12 level may be reduced.</p>

            <h4>Crohn Disease versus Ulcerative Colitis</h4>
            <p>These inflammatory bowel diseases share certain features, but there are fundamental and often distinguishing features. On occasion it may be very difficult to determine whether a patient has Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis, and in these circumstances the condition often is designated indeterminate colitis. The fundamental differences between Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are that Crohn disease begins in the submucosa and ulcerative colitis begins in the mucosa of the gut. Ulcerative colitis, as its name suggests, is a disease confined to the colon and rectum, whereas, as was stated above, Crohn disease is ubiquitous throughout the bowel. Full-thickness involvement of the bowel, although more common in Crohn disease, may occur in both disorders. Fibrosis cicatrization and fistula formation are confined almost exclusively to patients with Crohn disease. The histopathologic feature that differentiates the two conditions is the presence of granulomas in Crohn disease. Aphthoid ulcers are more likely to occur in patients with Crohn disease. Both conditions are associated with an increased incidence of colon cancer, which, however, is more likely to develop in long-standing ulcerative colitis than in Crohn disease. The incidence of malignant change in the colon or rectum of ulcerative colitis is approximately 20 percent after 25 years of disease activity. Many patients develop ulcerative colitis at a young age and therefore may develop cancerous changes in the colon in their forties or fifties. A further important consideration is that patients with inflammatory bowel disease live with episodes of diarrhea and occasional rectal bleeding so that the heralding features of malignancy may be observed by referring to the underlying inflammatory disease.</p>

            <h4>Treatment</h4>
            <h5>Pain Control and Anti-Inflammatory Agents</h5>
            <p>The treatment of Crohn disease can be divided into four areas of management: dealing with symptoms, treating mucosal inflammation, nutritional management, and surgery. Abdominal pain and diarrhea are dealt mostly by addressing intestinal inflammation. Pain may be due to the stretching of nerve endings as a result of distention from obstruction or inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided, and narcotics lead to addiction in this chronic condition. Acetaminophen, Tramadol, and Darvocet are used most frequently for pain control. 5-Aminosalicylic acid derivatives such as Azulfidine, Asacol, Pentasa, and Rowasa are used widely and have some effect. They are more effective in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn disease.</p>
            <h5>Steroids</h5>
            <p>Corticosteroids have been the mainstay in the acute treatment of Crohn disease for many years. Steroids should be used only when more conservative measures fail. The strategy employed is to induce remission by using high doses (prednisolone 60 mg per day) in the short term, followed by a temporary regime as soon as remission is induced. Maintenance therapy should employ the lowest dose possible. Approximately 20 percent of patients require long-term steroids.</p>
            <h5>Second-Line Agents</h5>
            <p>Steroid sparing in long-term management can be achieved with 6-mercaptopurine. This drug is slow to act and unpredictable in terms of achieving a therapeutic response. In doses of 50 to 125 mg daily, bone marrow suppression and other side effects are rare. The antibiotic metronidazole is also used as second-line therapy with a degree of success, particularly in treating fistulae. In addition to its properties as an antibiotic, the drug has an effect on the immune system. Other antibiotics that have been used to some effect are ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin.</p>
            <h5>Immune Suppressants</h5>
            <p>The immune suppressants methotrexate and cyclosporine have been shown to confer some benefit in the short term. The latest, still experimental, strategy in the treatment of Crohn disease involves the role of cytokines. Antitumor necrosis factor has been shown to be effective. Other cytokine therapies, such as the use of interleukin-11 (IL-11) and IL-10, have been reported to be efficacious in approximately 30 percent of cases.</p>
            <h5>Surgery</h5>
            <p>The cumulative risk of undergoing surgery sometime in the lives for patients with Crohn disease is approximately 90 percent, and the cumulative risk of recurrent disease at 20 years is 70 percent. Many recurrences may be asymptomatic, however. The major indication for surgery is failed medical therapy, usually in the presence of obstruction, fistula formation, and electrolyte or nutritional problems. Controversy still exists over how radical the surgeon should be in treating Crohn disease. Some studies show that the more disease-free the margins are after the resection, the less likely there is to be recurrent disease. Conversely, there is a danger that overly radical resections will leave the patient with the short bowel syndrome and its nutritional consequences. Conservative surgery in the form of stricturoplasty for short stenotic lesions that are producing obstructions can be helpful without the loss of any bowel. For longer diseased segments, resection is preferred to bypass. For colonic Crohn disease with severe rectal and anal involvement, a proctocolectomy with ileostomy may be required. Meticulous care is required in performing anastomoses in patients with Crohn disease, as healing is often impaired and the risk of anastomotic leakage therefore is increased.</p>

                <li><strong>C.</strong> Microscopic examination of the abnormal bowel from an individual with Crohn disease will reveal transmural inflammation with fibrosis, but the histologic feature that is most diagnostic of Crohn disease is the presence of noncaseating granulomas. This characteristic histologic feature, however, may be present in only approximately 50 percent of patients; however, the diagnosis of Crohn disease can still be made without finding granulomas by the characteristic clinical presentation, which includes the production of fissures, fistulae, and bowel obstruction by the transmural inflammation.</li>
                <li><strong>D.</strong> In the absence of bowel obstruction or fistula formation, several types of medical therapies have been used to treat the acute inflammation associated with Crohn disease. Corticosteroids, such as high-dose prednisolone, have been used commonly to treat the acute symptoms and induce remissions. In contrast, the antibiotic metronidazole may be used to treat patients with fistula formation, whereas the use of cytokines such as interleukin-10 is experimental. Surgical resection of bowel usually is done to treat problems such as obstruction.</li>
                <li><strong>A.</strong> Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are both inflammatory bowel diseases characterized by marked acute inflammation, but the inflammation in ulcerative colitis begins in the rectum and distal portions of the colon and precedes proximally without “skip lesions,” whereas the inflammation in Crohn disease can be found throughout the gastrointestinal tract (hence the alternate name “regional enteritis”). Another major difference between these two disorders is that with Crohn disease the inflammation, which may form noncaseating granulomas, begins in the submucosa and may involve the entire bowel wall, whereas ulcerative colitis begins in the mucosa and the inflammatory response remains superficial in location and does not involve the full thickness of the wall of the colon. The inflammation along with repair may form inflammatory polyps with both of these disorders.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Crohn disease is transmural (full thickness) and can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract.</li>
                <li>Intestinal strictures and fistulae are complications of Crohn disease.</li>
                <li>Individuals with Crohn disease have an increased risk of colon cancer, but the risk is lower than that with ulcerative colitis.</li>
                <li>Nongastrointestinal symptoms of Crohn disease involve the skin, joints, and eyes. Skin lesions include erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosa, aphthous stomatitis, and finger clubbing.</li>

            <h3>Answers to Case 7: Appendicitis</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 62-year-old man complains of midline abdominal pain. He denies being hit or suffering any other trauma. Over the next few hours, the pain worsens and is localized to the lower right quadrant. He also develops nausea and vomiting and, after 24 hours, develops fever and chills and an acute abdominal pain.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Acute appendicitis</li>
                <li><strong>Additional diagnostic tests:</strong> CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
            <p>This older man has a typical picture of a ruptured appendicitis with sepsis. He originally had mild right lower quadrant abdominal pain, but it worsened, and after 24 hours he developed fever and chills. Perhaps the most worrisome finding on physical examination is that he “appears ill.” He probably has sepsis, which is a systemic condition of infection-mediated illness. The chills probably reflect bacteremia. The emergency physician should expeditiously manage this situation, because delay could lead to morbidity or mortality, particularly in a geriatric patient. The blood pressure is not mentioned, but the patient could be in septic shock. Treatment should be addressed in a systematic manner: airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) with oxygen administered, two large-bore intravenous lines (IV), volume repletion for the probable volume depletion and sepsis, blood cultures, urine culture, and antibiotic therapy aimed at gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic bacteria. Blood work to be obtained includes a complete blood count and a chemistry panel to assess electrolytes and serum creatinine for kidney function. After stabilization, the patient should be taken to the operating room. If the diagnosis is unclear, a CT scan of the abdomen sometimes can help distinguish other abdominal pathologies, such as diverticulitis.</p>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <h4>Appendicitis</h4>
            <p>Acute appendicitis is a common disease in Western countries and is uncommon in Africa and Asia. The incidence of the disease in the United States has fallen considerably over the last 30 years; however, it remains the most common abdominal emergency in childhood, adolescence, and early adult life. Fewer than 5 percent of cases of acute appendicitis occur in patients over age 60 years.</p>
            <p>The pathologic process begins on the mucosal surface of the appendix, and there is often an element of obstruction of the appendicular lumen by a fecalith. This may lead to pressure necrosis of the mucosa and invasion of the appendicular wall by bacteria. Common causes of obstruction include elongation or kinking of the appendix, adhesions, and neoplasias such as carcinoma and carcinoid tumors, both of which are rare. Some cases spontaneously resolve, but more commonly, infection of the wall of the appendix progresses, leading to impairment of its blood supply. When the pathologic process has extended throughout the wall of the appendix to involve the parietal peritoneum, the pain and tenderness are classically over the McBurney point at the site of the appendix. The pathologic process may continue and produce gangrene, perforation, and more generalized peritonitis. Once perforation has occurred, the advancing bacteria may be controlled by the ability of the omentum to wall off the inflammation; alternatively, the peritonitis may become more widespread. In advanced appendicitis, a mass may develop; alternatively, generalized peritonitis may lead to the septic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), ultimately with the development of multiple organ failure and death.</p>
            <p>The site of the pain in appendicitis may vary. When the appendix is retrocecal in position, somatic pain may be perceived in the flank and loin rather than in the right lower quadrant. Anorexia is an almost invariable symptom in association with appendicitis. The presence of hunger usually eliminates this diagnosis. In association with anorexia, nausea is common and tends to proceed to vomiting. Diarrhea sometimes occurs and may be a result of the appendix lying in a pelvic position.</p>
            <p>Laboratory investigations commonly performed include the peripheral white blood cell count, which may be elevated with a predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The urinalysis is usually normal. A CT scan of the abdomen may show thickening of the appendix with periappendicular inflammation and the presence of intraperitoneal fluid.</p>
            <p>The differential diagnosis includes acute gastroenteritis, which typically has vomiting and diarrhea as prominent symptoms and abdominal pain that is less well defined. Intestinal obstruction must be considered and typically presents with vomiting and abdominal distention. Mesenteric adenitis may mimic appendicitis closely but is associated with a generalized viral illness and causes less severe pain. Inflammation of Meckel diverticulum may produce symptoms remarkably similar to those of appendicitis, and laparoscopy or laparotomy may be needed for the diagnosis. Crohn disease may closely simulate appendicitis; affected patients generally have intestinal obstruction, and usually conservative management is the best therapy. Gynecologic disorders such as pelvic inflammatory disease with cervical motion tenderness and adnexal tenderness may present similarly to appendicitis. Ureteral colic is associated with pain and tenderness of the flank area, radiating to the groin region. Other conditions include acute diverticulitis, colonic carcinoma, acute cholecystitis, and pancreatitis.</p>
            <p>Appendicitis in the elderly may have a more rapid course. Gangrene and perforation are more common in those over age 60 years, and this may be due to a delay in diagnosis. A classic picture of the appendicitis may be lacking, and the pain may be a less prominent feature. Overall, although there has been a decline in the incidence of peritonitis, paradoxically, it has increased among the elderly. Thus, appendicitis should be at the forefront of the differential diagnosis in males with right lower quadrant pain and tenderness.</p>
            <p>The treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis is surgical, consisting of an appendectomy. The abdomen is opened, and if the appendix is found to be normal in the absence of any other pathology, it should be removed prophylactically. At the present time, most appendixes are removed laparoscopically rather than in an open operation.</p>
            <h4>Diverticulitis</h4>
            <p>Diverticula are blind pouches involving the bowel. They result from herniation of the mucosa through the circular muscle at the site of small penetrating blood vessels. Their walls consist of an outer layer of serosa and an inner mucosa. There is no muscle in the wall of the diverticulum.</p>
            <p>Diverticular disease is associated with increased intraluminal pressure in the large intestine with hypertrophy of both circular and longitudinal muscle layers. Diverticula can occur anywhere in the large bowel and small bowel but are found most commonly in the sigmoid colon. Muscle hypertrophy predates the development of diverticula and results in a narrowing of the bowel and, consequently, an increase in the intraluminal pressure.</p>
            <p><strong>Figure 7-1:</strong> Top: Pathophysiology of diverticular disease. Bottom: Cross-sectional drawing of the colon, showing principal points of diverticula formation between mesenteric and antimesenteric teniae.</p>
            <p>Diverticular disease may produce central or left lower quadrant abdominal pain together with an alteration in bowel habit with occasional rectal bleeding. The diagnosis is confirmed by barium enema or colonoscopy, which will show muscle thickening and multiple diverticula with small orifices emerging through the colonic wall. Diverticular disease of the colon is common in Western countries and rare in central Africa, the Middle East, the Far East, and the Pacific islands. The incidence of the disease in Japan is increasing, possibly because of the adoption of a more westernized diet. African Americans residing in the United States now have an incidence of the disease equal to that of the white population. Epidemiologic studies support the concept that the disease is not racially determined but is related to changes in the environment and to dietary factors. Postmortem studies in the Western countries report an incidence of approximately 40 percent overall and one as high as 60 percent in those over age 60 years.</p>
            <p>Acute or chronic inflammation within a diverticulum is designated diverticulitis. It is estimated that the approximately 20 percent of patients with diverticulosis will manifest diverticulitis. Localized inflammation, or even perforation and peritonitis, may occur. Pneumaturia, resulting from a colovesical fistula, may occur, and on occasion, fecal material may be passed in the urine. CT imaging of the abdomen remains the primary method of diagnosing the acute process, whereas barium enema and endoscopic examinations are relatively contraindicated during acute infection.</p>
            <p>Known complications of diverticulitis include bleeding, abscess formation, peritonitis, and fistula formation. Colonic obstruction can also occur. The treatment of diverticulitis includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and nothing by mouth until the condition settles. Frank peritonitis or abscess formation usually requires surgical intervention, commonly involving excision of the affected area, such as a sigmoid colectomy. Postoperatively, patients should be instructed to eat a high-residue diet and drink plenty of liquids.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>E.</strong> The histologic hallmark of acute inflammation, such as that seen with acute appendicitis, is the presence of numerous acute inflammatory cells, namely, neutrophils. Therefore, histologic sections of an appendix surgically removed from an individual with acute appendicitis will reveal numerous neutrophils within the muscular wall. The inflammation can be so marked that it causes complete destruction of the muscular wall, which can lead to perforation and peritonitis.</li>
                <li><strong>D.</strong> Acute inflammation of diverticula (diverticulitis) will produce the sudden onset of left-sided abdominal pain accompanied by fever and peripheral leukocytosis (mainly neutrophils). These clinical signs are essentially the same as those seen with acute appendicitis except that the abdominal pain is on the left side rather than the right side. As such, diverticulitis sometimes is referred to as left-sided appendicitis.</li>
                <li><strong>B.</strong> Diverticulosis refers to the presence of numerous diverticula in the colon. The diverticula usually are located in the sigmoid colon in older individuals. Although they may become inflamed and produce signs of acute diverticulitis, more often they produce chronic blood loss as a result of chronic bleeding, which will lead to heme-positive stools and iron deficiency anemia.</li>

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 55-year-old woman has cirrhosis and elevated antimitochondrial antibodies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Primary biliary cirrhosis.</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
            <p>This 55-year-old woman presents with bleeding esophageal varices and cirrhosis. The first priorities in her management include ABC: airway, breathing, and circulation. She should receive oxygen by a nasal cannula, and two large-bore intravenous lines should be established. Her blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored to assess for volume loss and replacement with blood as needed. Because of her liver disease, she may have a coagulopathy caused by depletion of vitamin K–dependent factors (factors II, VII, IX, and X). Transfusion with coagulation factors and initiation of vitamin K may be indicated. Endoscopic examination to determine the etiology of the upper gastrointestinal bleeding is paramount. Bleeding esophageal varices may be treated with sclerotherapy injected into the bleeding vessels. Also, a tamponade may be attempted with special esophageal devices.</p>
            <p>After the acute situation has been addressed, attention should be directed to the etiology of her liver disease. A careful history and physical examination and selected laboratories usually yield the diagnosis. Toxic effects such as with alcohol use and infections such as with hepatitis viruses are the most common causes of cirrhosis. This patient’s hepatitis serology studies are negative, but she does have a history of Sjögren syndrome, Raynaud syndrome, and antimitochondrial antibodies. These findings are consistent with primary biliary cirrhosis. Careful history may reveal pruritus years before frank cirrhosis.</p>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <h4>Primary Biliary Cirrhosis</h4>
            <p>The etiology of primary biliary cirrhosis is not known; however, evidence points toward an autoimmune basis of the disease. Other autoimmune diseases are associated with this condition and include Sjögren syndrome, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, and thyroiditis. Aberrant human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules are expressed in the biliary epithelium of patients with PBC; this might be responsible for the triggering of an inflammatory response. Defective immunoregulation allows cytotoxic T cells to damage bile ducts. A liver biopsy usually shows a portal tract infiltrate composed of mainly lymphocytes and plasma cells. In approximately half the patients, granulomas may be seen. Destruction of medium-sized bile ducts with bile ductular proliferation will be evident. With time, hepatocyte necrosis and fibrosis are apparent. After years to decades, the clinical features of cirrhosis will be present. There is an increased synthesis of IgM because of failure to switch from immunoglobulin M (IgM) to IgG antibody synthesis. Most patients have antimitochondrial antibodies in their serum, with the antigen M2 being specific to PBC. The role of this antibody in the pathogenesis of PBC is not clear.</p>
            <p><strong>Figure 8-1:</strong> Microscopic pictograph of primary biliary cirrhosis. (Courtesy of Dr. Aaron Han, Reading, PA.)</p>
            <p>Features of cholestatic liver disease dominate the initial clinical picture. This includes pruritus, which may precede jaundice by years. High serum alkaline phosphatase with normal or nearly normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is characteristic in the early part of the disease. Secondary hypercholesteremia with features such as xanthelasma may be seen. After a variable amount of time (usually years), the features of cirrhosis, such as icterus, bleeding, and ascites, may become apparent.</p>
            <p><strong>Table 8-1: Laboratory Findings Consistent with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis</strong></p>
            <table>
                <tr><td>1. High serum alkaline phosphatase</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2. High serum cholesterol</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3. High serum IgM</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4. High antimitochondrial antibodies; M2 antibody is specific</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5. Liver biopsy; portal infiltrate with lymphocytes and plasma cells; granulomas; bile duct damage with ductular proliferation; eventual cirrhosis</td></tr>
            </table>
            <h4>Management</h4>
            <p>Treatment addresses the symptoms and disease course of the patient. Because the disease is thought to be autoimmune, corticosteroids have been tried. These agents improve the biochemical and histologic picture of the disease but lead to significant osteoporosis. Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are prone to osteoporosis caused by cholestasis and subsequent impaired malabsorption of vitamin D. Complications associated with cirrhosis requires management. Liver transplantation remains the specific treatment and has a 5-year survival of at least 80 percent.</p>
            <h4>Cirrhosis and Chronic Hepatitis</h4>
            <p>Chronic liver disease includes chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. In chronic hepatitis, inflammatory cells consisting of lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells are present in the portal tract. Interface hepatitis and bridging necrosis are signs of active liver damage. Lymphoid aggregates are seen in cases caused by hepatitis C virus. The hallmark of irreversible liver damage is deposition of fibrous tissue. This brings about the onset of cirrhosis. Initially, the fibrosis is periportal. With time, bridging fibrosis between lobules is seen. Regenerating nodules from surviving hepatocytes complete the picture of cirrhosis. Based on the size of the nodules, there are two types of cirrhosis: micronodular (nodules less than 3 mm) and macronodular. Micronodular cirrhosis is seen in alcoholics, whereas macronodular cirrhosis is seen after hepatitis.</p>

            <h4>Autoimmune Liver Disease</h4>
            <p>Autoimmune liver disease is seen most frequently in females and is associated with other autoimmune diseases. Autoantibodies such as antinuclear, anti-smooth muscle and anti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies (anti-LKM) are frequently present. Serum IgG levels may be elevated.</p>
            <h4>α1-Antitrypsin Deficiency</h4>
            <p>α1-Antitrypsin deficiency is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition. α1-Antitrypsin is a glycoprotein whose main role is to inhibit the proteolytic enzyme neutrophil elastase. Deficiency results in liver damage and emphysema, especially in smokers. Serum levels are low, and liver biopsy shows periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive diastase-resistant globules within the hepatocytes.</p>
            <h4>Wilson Disease</h4>
            <p>Wilson disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition. The copper-transporting protein ceruloplasmin is reduced in amount because of poor synthesis. There is also failure of biliary excretion of copper. As a result, free copper is deposited in various sites, including liver basal ganglia and cornea (with resultant Kayser-Fleischer rings), resulting in damage to those organs. Urinary excretion of free copper also is increased. Acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and extrapyramidal features (caused by basal ganglia damage) are the usual clinical features.</p>
            <h4>Hereditary Hemochromatosis</h4>
            <p>Hereditary hemochromatosis also is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition. There is an association with HLA-A3. Excessive iron absorption results in iron deposition and damage to various organs including liver, pancreas, heart, joints, and pituitary gland. At the same time excess iron deposition is observed in the skin. This results in bronze discoloration of skin. This, along with diabetes resulting from pancreatic damage, explains the synonym of hemochromatosis, bronze diabetes. Other features include cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, hypogonadism, and arthropathy. As females lose iron through blood loss from menstruation, the features are milder or are seen later in them.</p>
            <h4>Alcoholic Liver Disease</h4>
            <p>The spectrum of alcoholic liver disease includes fatty liver, acute hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Fatty liver (hepatic steatosis) consists of microvesicular lipid droplets in the liver cells, displacing the nucleus to the periphery. On gross inspection, the liver appears yellow and greasy. Refraining from alcohol generally leads to reversal of these changes. In acute hepatitis, there is infiltration with polymorphonucleocytes and hepatocyte necrosis. Cytoplasmic inclusions resulting from intermediate filaments known as Mallory bodies are seen. Eventually, fibrosis ensues. Finally, cirrhosis develops as an end-stage result of chronic alcohol use. The liver is small and shrunken. Microscopy reveals fibrous septae that create a micronodular and macronodular pattern with regeneration. Clinically, the patient may develop portal hypertension, ascites, jaundice, and peripheral edema.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>C.</strong> The presence of antimitochondrial serum antibodies, particularly to the M2 antigen, in an individual with liver disease is highly suggestive of primary biliary cirrhosis. Individuals with this autoimmune disorder, which is more common in women, develop clinical signs of cholestatic liver disease with pruritus. Before the development of jaundice, however, patients will have high serum levels of alkaline phosphatase with normal or nearly normal levels of ALT and AST.</li>
                <li><strong>E.</strong> Increased serum levels of copper with decreased levels of ceruloplasmin in a patient with liver disease are diagnostic of Wilson disease. This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by the deposition of copper in multiple sites, which include the liver, the basal ganglia, and the cornea of the eye. Destruction of the basal ganglia leads to extrapyramidal signs such as choreiform movements, whereas deposition of copper at the periphery of the cornea produces characteristic Kayser-Fleischer rings.</li>
                <li><strong>C.</strong> Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis develop clinical signs because of the deposition of excess iron in many organs. The classic triad of clinical signs includes a bronze skin color, diabetes mellitus, and cirrhosis. The combination of the bronze skin color and diabetes mellitus sometimes is referred to as bronze diabetes. Deposition of iron in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas leads to the destruction of the β-cells, and subsequent decreased levels of insulin lead to diabetes mellitus. The abnormal skin color results from the deposition of iron in the skin. In addition, deposition of iron in the adrenal cortex leads to decreased cortisol levels. This in turn will increase levels of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and lead to increased melanin-stimulating hormone (MSH) activity.</li>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <p>Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer of the female lower reproductive system. More than 80 percent of cervical dysplasias and more than 90 percent of cervical cancers are associated with HPV infection. Because HPV is transmitted through sexual contact, many of the risk factors for cervical cancer involve behaviors that increase the risk of all sexually transmitted diseases. These risk factors include early intercourse, many sexual partners, high-risk sexual partners, infection with other sexually transmitted diseases, and immunosuppression by HIV infection. Relative risk factors may include oral contraceptive use, tobacco use, and immunodeficiency. Other possible risk factors are under investigation.</p>
            <p>Cervical dysplasia is found most often in females in their twenties, whereas cervical cancers usually become evident in the fifth decade of life. The classic presentation of cervical malignancies includes abnormal bleeding and leukorrhea. The bleeding can range from blood streaking in a discharge or spotting to heavy bright red blood. Foul-smelling purulent leukorrhea is often present. Other symptoms, such as pelvic or leg pain, urinary or fecal material in the vagina, weight loss, and generalized weakness, are suggestive of advanced disease.</p>
            <p>The squamocolumnar junction is where the squamous ectocervix abuts the columnar endocervix. Just distal to this junction there is an area of squamous metaplasia that is influenced by factors such menarche, pregnancy, local hormonal influences, infection, and trauma. As columnar epithelium is replaced by squamous cells, a new squamocolumnar junction is formed. The area between the old junction and the new junction is called the transformation zone. It is in this transformation zone that most cervical cancers arise.</p>
            <p>Cervical cancer begins with infection of cervical epithelium by human papillomavirus. Most infections resolve spontaneously without progression to cancer. This suggests that viral infection alone is not responsible for cervical cancer and that other, undefined factors are involved in the pathogenesis. Additionally, there are many types of HPV that vary in oncogenic potential, with subtypes 16 and 18 being found most commonly in cervical cancer. Progression to dysplasia will occur if the viral genome is integrated into the nucleus of the cell under the influence of other factors that contribute to a favorable environment. Distinct cellular changes will occur, representing malignant transformation to low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I). A typical lesion will appear slightly raised or thickened with koilocytes in the upper and middle epithelial layers. Koilocytes are cells that have undergone cellular changes because of the presence of a virus. These cells are pleomorphic, hyperchromic, and multinucleated and have perinuclear halos. There are few if any mitotic figures and no atypical mitotic figures in CIN I, usually involving the lower third of the epithelium.</p>
            <p>These low-grade CIN I lesions may regress spontaneously without treatment but may progress to higher-grade lesions. When atypical cells spread to between the lower one-third and two-thirds of the epithelium or the majority of the cells of the keratinizing layers, the lesion is defined as CIN II. These lesions demonstrate some areas of maturation but have areas of immature atypical koilocytic cells with a decreased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio and increased numbers of mitotic figures. Progression to CIN III involves the upper one-third of the epithelium by atypical cells with loss of maturation, an increase in hyperchromasia, and more mitotic figures with atypical mitoses. As the lesion progresses to squamous carcinoma in situ, the dysplastic cells may lose their cell walls and form syncytial-like groups. Many small round nuclei with scant cytoplasm can be seen. The majority of cells are atypical and are more hyperchromatic with coarse chromatin, a higher degree of pleomorphism, and increased atypical mitoses. Carcinoma in situ becomes invasive squamous cell carcinoma when atypical cells invade the basement membrane. Invasive carcinoma has wide variations of irregularly shaped cells and may have keratin pearls. There may also be evidence of necrosis, hemorrhage, and inflammatory cells.</p>
            <p>The progression from CIN to cervical cancer is a slow process that usually occurs over several years. This allows many opportunities for screening before advanced-stage disease is evident. Most cases of cervical dysplasia are asymptomatic, and the diagnosis is made when a Pap smear reveals abnormal cytology. Good screening of asymptomatic patients, including a thorough history and physical and routine Pap smears have led to a decreased incidence of cervical cancer. The role of the Pap smear is paramount in early detection of cervical dysplasia to afford timely treatment and avoid progression to invasive cervical cancer. Even after the development of cervical cancer, a Pap smear has an important role in detection because diagnosis early in the disease process may offer a better prognosis. Treatment of early cervical cancer offers a 95 percent cure rate, whereas more advanced stages often lead to death in more than a third of cases. This underscores the importance of diligent efforts by the physician in counseling patients to receive an annual Pap smear.</p>

                <li><strong>[9.1]</strong> D. Koilocytes are squamous epithelial cells that have nuclei with dense, hyperchromatic, condensed chromatin surround by a clear space. These cells have been described as having the appearance of a raisin. Koilocytes are the characteristic cytopathic effect of HPV. These changes are present in biopsy specimens from the cervix, but they can also be seen in Pap smears from the cervix where these abnormal dysplastic cells have a characteristic increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio.</li>
                <li><strong>[9.2]</strong> B. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I entails mild squamous dysplasia that involves the lower third of the epithelium of the cervix. Because the basal cells (those closest to the basement membrane) are the actively dividing cells, especially in an area of squamous metaplasia (transformation zone), they are the ones affected by HPV. This infection forms koilocytes, which are characteristic of HPV.</li>
                <li><strong>[9.3]</strong> D. The most common histologic type of invasive malignancy of the cervix is squamous cell carcinoma. Microscopy may reveal wide variations (pleomorphism) of irregularly shaped squamous epithelial cells which may have intracytoplasmic keratin. Keratin pearls may also be present. Necrosis, hemorrhage, and inflammatory cells are also typically seen. Cervical squamous cell carcinoma arises from previous squamous dysplasia of the cervix that has progressed from mild dysplasia to moderate dysplasia to severe dysplasia and finally to involve the full thickness of the cervical epithelium (carcinoma in situ). The latter then becomes invasive squamous cell carcinoma when atypical cells invade through the basement membrane. Cervical squamous cell carcinoma is then classified as being either microinvasive or invasive.</li>

        <h2>Case 10: Ovarian Teratoma</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Case Description</h3>
            <p>A 21-year-old nulliparous woman complains of lower abdominal “heaviness.” She takes an oral contraceptive and is in a monogamous relationship. On examination, she has a normal-sized, nontender uterus, and a 9-cm right adnexal mass is palpated. Her pregnancy test is negative. On sonography, the mass appears cystic and solid.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the most likely diagnosis?</li>
                <li>What are some of the histologic findings expected in this mass?</li>

            <h3>Answers to Case 10: Ovarian Teratoma</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong>: A 21-year-old nulliparous woman has a 9-cm right adnexal mass that on sonography appears cystic and solid.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis</strong>: Benign cystic teratoma of the ovary</li>
                <li><strong>Expected histologic findings in this mass</strong>: Any tissue may be found, but the most common are sebum, skin, hair, teeth, thyroid, and neurologic tissues</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
            <p>This young woman has an ovarian mass that on ultrasound has cystic and solid components, a classic presentation of a benign cystic teratoma (dermoid cyst) of the ovary. Although benign cystic teratomas are often asymptomatic, larger dermoids (as in this case) can present with pelvic pain, pressure, fullness, or dyspareunia. The patient’s pregnancy test was reported as negative; however, in rare cases, degenerating ectopic pregnancies can be missed with urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) assays because of the low sensitivity of urine pregnancy tests in the presence of very low (<25 mIU/mL) serum hCG levels. The fact that the patient is engaged in a monogamous relationship should decrease the risks of her contracting gonorrhea or Chlamydia, hence decreasing the possibility of pelvic inflammatory disease and tuboovarian abscess (TOA). The patient also gives a history of oral contraceptive (OC) use, which also serves to decrease the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and/or TOA. Oral contraceptives also greatly decrease the likelihood of the mass being a physiologic ovarian mass (follicular cyst, hemorrhagic corpus luteum cyst, etc.). The ultrasound shows a complex (both cystic and solid) ovarian mass, which also is not consistent with an abscess or a physiologic ovarian or paraovarian cyst.</p>
            <p>Although some disagreement exists over the timing and indications for surgery in complex masses under 6 cm or simple cysts of any size, a 9-cm complex ovarian mass almost always needs to be explored surgically. This is due primarily to the small but not insignificant risk of malignancy. Upon confirmation of benign intraoperative findings, efforts should be directed at salvaging all normal tissue from the affected ovary and removing only that tissue which has undergone neoplastic degeneration.</p>

                <li><strong>Tuboovarian abscess</strong>: An abscess formed within the adnexal space consisting of ovary, fallopian tube, and matted bowel caused by untreated or inadequately treated pelvic inflammatory disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Endometrioma</strong>: A large (6- to 8-cm) loculated collection of endometrial tissue that can develop in the pelvis in females with endometriosis. As this tissue degenerates, it turns brownish in color and is known as a “chocolate cyst.”</li>
                <li><strong>Struma ovarii</strong>: A benign teratoma in which functional thyroid tissue is the predominant histologic finding. Approximately 2 to 3 percent of teratomas are classified as struma ovarii. Thyrotoxicosis is clinically apparent in 5 percent of these cases.</li>
                <li><strong>Ovarian torsion</strong>: A condition in which the ovary twists on its attachment to the infundibulopelvic ligament, thus interrupting ovarian blood supply. This usually is seen in conjunction with pathologic enlargement of the ovary and can be dynamic (intermittent) in nature or complete; the latter results in infarction and necrosis of the affected ovary.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <p>Although they may present in any decade of life, benign cystic teratomas are the most common ovarian neoplasm found in females under age 35 (excluding physiologic follicular and corpus luteum cysts) and are also the most common ovarian neoplasm found in pregnancy. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of all cases involve both ovaries. Benign cystic teratomas arise from a single germ cell in the ovary and have a normal female karyotype (46,XX). Because of the pluripotent nature of germ cells, teratomas can differentiate into tissues derived from all three embryologic cell lines (endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm). Thus, a “mature” teratoma often contains skin, fat, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, hair, smooth and striated muscle, cartilage, bone, teeth, neural tissue, and gastrointestinal tissue. Functional thyroid tissue is found in approximately 12 percent of benign cystic teratomas, and rarely this tissue will proliferate into the predominant cellular element in the teratoma. This unique teratoma hence is referred to as struma ovarii and will secrete enough functional thyroid hormone to cause acute thyrotoxicosis in approximately 5 percent of cases.</p>
            <p>Benign cystic teratomas are usually asymptomatic and are found most commonly during routine gynecologic screening or incidentally during unassociated surgical or radiographic procedures. Larger teratomas give rise to acute adnexal torsion in approximately 11 percent of cases. The increased risk of torsion with teratomas compared with other causes of ovarian enlargement is thought to be due to fat content, allowing the teratoma to “float” in the abdominal cavity instead of lodging against other structures. Other significant complications include secondary infection and acute hemorrhage with the potential for septic and/or hypovolemic shock. Rupture or perforation is seen in less than 5 percent of cases and occurs more frequently in association with pregnancy. When acute rupture occurs, spillage of the contents of the teratoma into the abdominal cavity often precipitates a surgical emergency, whereas more chronic leakage of contents can produce a severe chemical peritonitis that also requires surgical intervention. Malignant degeneration occurs in less than 2 percent of all recognized teratomas.</p>
            <p>Other germ cell tumors include dysgerminomas, endodermal sinus tumors, and choriocarcinomas. These neoplasms usually occur in females under age 30 years. Dysgerminomas are rapidly growing and very radiosensitive and chemosensitive. Endodermal sinus tumors often secrete α-fetoprotein, whereas choriocarcinomas secrete human chorionic gonadotropin. Epithelial tumors of the ovary most commonly affect females over age 30 years, particularly postmenopausal women. Malignant serous cystadenocarcinomas are the most common, usually presenting with ascites. Treatment includes surgical excision followed by combination chemotherapy. Mucinous tumors may become very large, sometimes exceeding 30 lb in weight; their rupture can lead to chronic bouts of bowel obstruction (pseudomyxoma peritonei).</p>
            <p>Stromal tumors of the ovary are often functional, secreting estrogen (granulosa-theca cell tumors) or androgens (Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors). These neoplasms can present as precocious puberty, postmenopausal bleeding, or hirsutism. They are usually solid tumors that are slow growing and rarely metastasize early. Surgery is the best treatment for these tumors.</p>

            <h4>Answers</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>[10.1]</strong> D. Mucinous tumors of the ovary, the histology of which reveals the presence of nonciliated mucinous columnar epithelial cells similar to the endocervix, can rupture and cause widespread abdominal dissemination of the mucinous material. This condition, which is called pseudomyxoma peritonei, may cause compression of abdominal organs, such as the bowel or kidneys.</li>
                <li><strong>[10.2]</strong> E. The benign cystic teratoma or dermoid cyst is the most common type of ovarian tumor in females younger than age 30 years. Dermoid cysts, which usually have solid and cystic components when found in the ovary, are composed of elements from multiple embryonic layers, such as mature skin, bone, cartilage, and teeth.</li>
                <li><strong>[10.3]</strong> D. This young girl has signs of precocious puberty. Thus, the adnexal mass is likely to be an estrogen-secreting granulosa-theca cell tumor. These low-grade malignancies are slow-growing so-called stromal cell tumors. The androgen-secreting tumors are usually Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors and may cause virilism.</li>
                <li><strong>[10.4]</strong> C. The presence of a ulcerated gastric mass along with bilateral ovarian masses suggests that the patient’s gastric cancer has metastasized to the ovaries; this is known as a Krukenberg tumor. Histology typically shows “signet ring” cells, in which intracytoplasmic mucin fills the cell and pushes the nucleus to the periphery of the cell, leading to the histologic appearance of a signet ring.</li>

            <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
            <p>This patient, a young man with “scrotal heaviness,” represents a very typical presentation of a testicular mass. Not all masses in the scrotum are testicular in nature. Physical examination and ultrasound of the scrotum often help differentiate a solid testicular mass from benign entities such as hydrocele (water sac around the testicle), varicocele (dilated testicular veins), and epididymoorchitis (infection and/or inflammation of the epididymis and testis).</p>
            <p>A hard painless mass within the testicle should be considered testicular cancer until proved otherwise. Such a mass often is overlooked by the patient until it is discovered accidentally or brought to his attention by an unrelated regional occurrence such as minor trauma to the scrotum. Germ cell tumors of the testis peak in men between ages 15 and 40 years. Seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma can appear in a pure or, more often, mixed form. Characterizing the tumor awaits review of the surgical specimen and is not possible before orchiectomy (surgical removal of the testicle). Although cure of testicular tumors now occurs in the high 90 percent range, because the malignancy affects primarily young men, issues of compromised fertility, complications of therapy, and surveillance for recurrence and second malignancies are matters of concern.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cryptorchidism</strong>: Congenital failure of one or both testes to descend from the abdominal (in utero) position to the scrotal postnatal position. Cryptorchid testicles have a higher incidence of malignancy, which is not reduced by surgical relocation into the scrotum. Patients who have had surgical correction of cryptorchid testes require intensive education about the importance of self-examination because of the increased risk of malignancy.</li>
                <li><strong>Radical orchiectomy</strong>: Removal of the testicle, epididymis, and testicular cord up to the internal inguinal ring. This operation is performed through an incision in the inguinal area that is similar to the incision made to repair inguinal hernias.</li>
                <li><strong>Nonseminomatous germ cell tumors</strong>: Because of the distinct difference in treatment of a pure seminoma, germ cell tumors often are divided into two categories: (1) pure seminomas and (2) nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (all other pure tumors or seminomas with a mixed component). Pure seminomas are very radiosensitive, whereas nonseminomatous tumors are radioresistant.</li>
                <li><strong>Tumor markers</strong>: Substances secreted by cancers that can be detected and measured to assess the presence and extent of the primary, metastatic, or recurrent disease. α-Fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin–β are tumor markers for testicular cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND)</strong>: Removal of lymph nodes that provide the primary lymphatic drainage from the testes from the bifurcation of the great vessels up to and beyond the renal hilum. This procedure may be curative in cases of low-volume metastatic disease, because most germ cell tumors progress in an orderly fashion from primary intratesticular to lymphatic before metastasis to solid organs.</li>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <p>Any male presenting with an intrascrotal mass requires a thorough physical examination of the genitalia. The examination should be performed with the male standing as well as lying flat. The primary goal is to determine whether the mass lies within the testicle or is extratesticular. Masses within the testes require further evaluation. Scrotal ultrasound is an excellent study to confirm the presence of and characterize a suspected testicular mass. If an intratesticular mass is confirmed on examination and/or ultrasound study, the diagnosis of a germ cell tumor is made by inguinal orchiectomy and pathologic analysis of the testis. Once the diagnosis of a germ cell tumor is confirmed and characterized by the histology, tumor staging is performed.</p>
            <p>Before an inguinal orchiectomy, serum markers are drawn, such as α-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin–β levels, if a germ cell tumor is confirmed. A CT scan of the abdomen is obtained after the inguinal orchiectomy, looking for the presence of enlarged lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum. The use of intravascular contrast material helps outline the aorta and vena cava, on which lies the primary lymphatic drainage echelon of the testis. A chest radiograph is obtained with additional views if needed. These staging studies augment the physical examination, which assesses for abdominal masses, breast enlargement (caused by the influence of serum tumor markers), and the Virchow lymph node in the supraclavicular region.</p>
            <p>Patients with pure seminoma and disease that is thought not to be metastatic are treated with a short course of radiotherapy to the retroperitoneal and ipsilateral iliac lymph nodes. Such simple therapy yields 90 percent 5-year disease-free survival. For patients with mixed germ cell tumors, treatment depends on the presence and extent of metastatic disease. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection may be chosen as a therapy when there is no evidence of gross metastatic involvement. Surgery will define the extent of disease and in some cases may cure the malignancy.</p>
            <p>For patients for whom chemotherapy is chosen, a variety of chemotherapeutic protocols exists that are administered using x-ray and serum studies to monitor effectiveness. Sometimes metastatic deposits will be reduced but not eliminated by the chemotherapy, requiring surgical excision.</p>
            <p>The five types of germ cell tumors—seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma—are collectively responsible for approximately 90 percent of testicular tumors. The remaining testicular tumors originate from the gonadal stroma, such as Leydig and Sertoli cells. A variety of rare tumors occur with a frequency far less than that of the more common germ cell tumors. The histologic subtype of germ cell tumors is an important distinction, because therapy is predicated on a complete examination of the entire tumor to determine whether it is of pure type or mixed in origin. Pure seminomas are distinct from other solid tumors of the testicle in that seminomas are exquisitely radiosensitive. Other germ cell tumors, whether in pure or mixed form, do not have sufficient radiosensitivity to make radiation therapy a commonly employed treatment modality.</p>
            <p>Whatever combination of radiation, surgery, and/or chemotherapy is used, patients with testis tumor often are cured of their malignancies. After a diagnosis of testis cancer, the patient is warned that therapies, especially chemotherapy, can have a negative long-term impact on fertility. Some patients choose to bank sperm before the initiation of chemotherapy. All patients with testis tumor have at least a 5-year period of intensive monitoring on or off therapy. Compliance with the rigorous program of physical examinations, x-rays, and blood tests must be stressed to the patient. Radiation, surgery, and chemotherapy have their own distinct set of side effects, which, depending on the patient’s age, may be not only short-term but also long-term, revealing themselves many decades later.</p>

            <h4>Answers</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>[11.1]</strong> A. An intratesticular mass in an adult, especially a mass that does not transilluminate, should be considered a testicular tumor until proved otherwise. The two main types of primary testicular tumors are germ cell tumors and sex cord gonadal stroma. Germ cell tumors are more common and have a peak incidence in men between 15 and 40 years of age.</li>
                <li><strong>[11.2]</strong> A. The histologic classification of testicular germ cell tumors includes seminomas, embryonal carcinomas, yolk sac tumors, choriocarcinomas, and teratomas. It is important, however, to group these testicular tumors into two general categories: those which are pure seminomas and those tumors which contain nonseminomatous elements. The reason for this classification is the fact that pure seminomas are very radiosensitive and nonseminomatous tumors are radioresistant and require the use of chemotherapy.</li>
                <li><strong>[11.3]</strong> C. Tumors sometimes secrete specific substances that appear in the serum. These tumor markers can be used clinically for diagnosis, for staging, and for following patients after surgery to look for recurrences of the tumor. Two important tumor markers associated with testicular neoplasms are α-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin–β (hCG-β). Increased levels of AFP are associated with embryonal cell carcinoma or endodermal sinus tumor, whereas increased levels of hCG are associated with choriocarcinoma. Increased levels of both AFP and hCG are seen with mixed germ cell tumors. It is important to note that although seminomas may be associated with increased levels of hCG, pure seminomas are never associated with increased levels of AFP.</li>

            <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
            <p>The most important first step in evaluating a patient suspected of having a stroke is to address ABCs: airway, breathing, and circulation. After a quick assessment and stabilization, treatment should be instituted. Earlier treatment offers a greater benefit to the patient. A complete history and physical should be directed at the central nervous system, the cardiac system, mental status, and a differential diagnosis. Carotid artery bruits may be a sign of arterial narrowing or stenosis. Neurologic deficits, mental status changes, and assessment of language function to detect aphasia are important. Laboratory evaluation includes obtaining a complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, a chemistry panel, a rapid plasma reagin (RPR), antiphospholipid antibodies, a cholesterol level, a triglyceride level, a urine drug screen, coagulation tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG), a CT scan of the head (without contrast) for detecting hemorrhage, and blood cultures if endocarditis is suspected. Lumbar puncture is performed if the CT scan is negative. A cerebrovascular accident (ischemic stroke) may be caused by complete occlusion of the internal carotid artery, resulting in embolization to the right middle cerebral artery. Other possible causes include intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), hematoma, transient ischemic attack (TIA), encephalitis, brain tumor, brain abscess, epilepsy, and trauma. The differential diagnosis for ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes includes seizures, syncope, hypoglycemia, psychiatric disorder, cerebral infections, and drug toxicity. Cardiac causes include rheumatic heart disease, mitral valve disease, cardiac arrhythmia, infective endocarditis, atrial myxoma, mural thrombi complicating myocardial infarction, atrial septal defect, and patent foramen ovale.</p>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <p>Stroke, or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Strokes are divided into two categories: ischemic infarcts and hemorrhages. Infarcts can be thrombotic (atherosclerotic), cardioembolic, or lacunar in origin. Lacunar infarcts are small, less than 5 mm, and occur in short penetrating arterioles. Infarcts account for 85 percent of strokes. Hemorrhages can be either intracerebral, such as a hematoma, or aneurysmal. The most common cause of a subarachnoid hemorrhage is an aneurysm. Long-standing hypertension is the most common cause of intracerebral hemorrhage. Hemorrhages account for 15 percent of strokes. Patients often develop symptoms before the ischemic event. Patients with a history of atherosclerosis have a history of transient ischemic attacks 50 percent of the time. TIAs usually last less than 24 hours.</p>
            <h4>Normal Anatomy</h4>
            <p>Two sets of arteries perfuse the brain: the paired internal carotids and the paired vertebral arteries. The common carotid artery bifurcates into the internal and external carotids. The internal carotid (ICA) supplies 80 percent of cerebral blood flow. Twenty percent comes from the vertebral arteries. The ICA frequently is affected by atherosclerosis.</p>
            <h4>Pathophysiology</h4>
            <p>Stenosis of the internal carotid arteries leads to ischemic stroke by two mechanisms: thrombus and embolization. Complete occlusion of the ICA can result in embolization to the middle cerebral artery (MCA) when there is poor collateral flow through the circle of Willis. This leads to distal hypoperfusion and ischemic injury. A watershed area of infarction can occur in the brain and can cause clinically a contralateral proximal arm and leg weakness. Stroke also may be caused by hemorrhage. Nontraumatic ICH most commonly is due to long-standing hypertension, with the basal ganglia being the most common site involved. The hemorrhages are caused by rupture of microscopic aneurysms that form on small arteries.</p>
            <h4>Pathology</h4>
            <p>The bulk of the brain is formed by two large paired cerebral hemispheres. Each hemisphere is divided into four lobes. The autoregulatory capacity of the brain keeps a constant average level of cerebral blood flow. Ischemic changes in the brain can be diffuse or local. Diffuse pattern of cortical injury can occur. The brain becomes edematous, and blood vessels are dilated. There is an increase in petechial hemorrhage in the cortical fibers. Focal areas of ischemia can be seen as a very bland or a white area. The brain can soften in the area of the infarct, and petechia can develop if a hemorrhage occurs after the infarct. The infarcted tissue becomes vacuolated and can become spongy. In a cerebral hemorrhage, the blood dissects and destroys brain tissue, forming a hematoma that can expand and act like a space-occupying tumor. Initially, the hematoma becomes cystic and then discolored secondary to the presence of hemosiderin macrophages. The necrotic tissue can become edematous and vacuolated.</p>
            <h4>Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</h4>
            <p>The most common cause of significant subarachnoid hemorrhage is rupture of berry (saccular) aneurysms. These outpouchings usually occur at the anastomosis points of the circle of Willis. They are usually less than 3 cm in diameter and can be as small as several millimeters. Rupture can occur at any age, but usually occur in the fourth or fifth decade of life. Bigger aneurysms have a higher chance of rupture. Valsalva or sexual orgasm is associated with rupture. Additionally, berry aneurysms are often seen in patients with polycystic kidney disease. Patients describe symptoms of aneurysm rupture as “the worst headache of my life.” Up to half of individuals who suffer a berry aneurysm rupture will die.</p>
            <h4>Management of Ischemic Stroke</h4>
            <p>Oxygen should be administered to any stroke victim. With ischemic strokes, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a thrombolytic therapy that may be considered, but to be effective, it must be administered within 3 hours after the onset of the ischemic event. Contraindications to its use are blood pressure higher than 185/110 mm Hg and evidence of a cerebral hemorrhage. Antihypertensives should be given to achieve a systolic blood pressure of 170 to 200 mm Hg within the first 2 weeks. The National Stroke Association (NSA) recommends treatment for blood pressures higher than 220/120 mm Hg on repeated measures over 1 hour. The goal is to lower the blood pressure gradually, not to lower the blood pressure to normal levels initially in the acute phase. After a stroke, there is loss of cerebral autoregulation, and lowering the blood pressure too quickly may compromise the circulation further. Aspirin is started daily; it can reduce the risk of recurrence. Corticosteroids are used to decrease the edema and intracranial pressure. If there is a cardiac source of embolization, anticoagulation is instituted.</p>
            <h4>Management of Hemorrhagic Stroke</h4>
            <p>The treatment of an intracranial hemorrhage includes supportive measures and treatment of hypertension. The prognosis depends on the level of consciousness, the size and location of the hematoma, and the underlying medical condition. The larger the hemorrhage, the poorer the prognosis. With a subarachnoid hemorrhage, patients may need surgical clipping for aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations. If the patient is conscious, he or she should be confined to bed with no exertion, and any anxiety should be treated. Stool softeners may help avoid straining.</p>

            <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
            <p>This 86-year-old man has dementia, which is impaired cognitive function with slow progression, as represented by forgetfulness, disorientation, alterations in mood, and difficulty with speech. He has wandered from his home, which is a common behavior among patients with dementia. He does not have a history of head trauma or neurologic symptoms, which may indicate a brain tumor, a subarachnoid hemorrhage, or an infection such as syphilis. Depression or stroke is also in the differential diagnosis. Thus, the workup of dementia includes a careful history and physical examination, an assay for vitamin B12 deficiency, syphilis serology, HIV serology, thyroid function testing, testing for systemic lupus erythematosus, and CT imaging of the brain. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer disease, which has a predilection for those of advanced age. This individual has a moderate to severe form of the disease; more advanced disease may include immobility, being mute, and being severely disabled.</p>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. The disease usually becomes apparent with slow impairment of higher intellectual function and alterations in behavior and mood. Later, progressive disorientation, memory loss, and aphasia indicate severe cortical dysfunction, and eventually the patient becomes noncommunicative and immobile. Patients usually become symptomatic after 50 years of age, and the progressive increase in the incidence of the disease in recent years has given rise to major medical, social, and economic problems in countries with a growing number of elderly individuals. When considered by age groups, the rates are 3 percent for those aged 65 to 74 years, 19 percent for those aged 75 to 84 years, and 47 percent for those aged 85 years or more. Most cases are sporadic, but up to 10 percent of cases are familial. Pathologic changes identical to those observed in Alzheimer disease occur in almost all older patients with Down syndrome. Although histologic analysis of brain tissue is the “gold standard” for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, it rarely is needed in clinical practice. The combination of clinical assessment and modern imaging allows an accurate diagnosis in the vast majority of cases.</p>
            <p>Pathologically, the brain shows a variable degree of cortical atrophy with widening of the sulci and ventriculomegaly because of the loss of brain tissue. The major microscopic abnormalities of Alzheimer disease are neurofibrillary tangles, senile or neuritic plaques, and amyloid angiopathy. All these abnormalities may be present to a lesser extent in the brains of nondemented elderly people. The diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is based on a combination of clinical and pathologic features.</p>
            <p>Neurofibrillary tangles are filament bundles in the cytoplasm of the neurons that displace or encircle the nucleus. They often have an elongated “flame” shape or take on a rounded contour. They are visible as basophilic fibrillary structures. They are found commonly in cortical neurons, especially in the entorhinal cortex; in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus; and in the amygdala. Neurofibrillary tangles are insoluble, and so they remain in tissue sections as “ghost” tangles long after the death of the neuron. Neurofibrillary tangles are composed predominantly of paired helical filaments with some straight filaments that appear to have a comparable composition. A major component of paired helical filaments is abnormally hyperphosphorylated forms of the protein tau, an axonal microtubule-associated protein that enhances microtubule assembly.</p>
            <p>Neuritic plaques can be found in the hippocampus and amygdala as well as in the neocortex. The major motor and sensory cortex regions generally are spared. These lesions have been described as spherical in shape, taking up Congo red or silver stain, and tortuous in appearance. The amyloid core, which can be stained by Congo red, contains several abnormal proteins.</p>
            <p>Although there is some disagreement about the best histologic criteria for Alzheimer disease, the number of neurofibrillary tangles correlates better with clinical impairment than does the number of neuritic plaques. Although amyloid-rich plaques correlate less well with dementia and clinical disease than do neurofibrillary tangles, most current work has focused on the role of amyloid because of its relative specificity for Alzheimer disease and because of evidence from familial Alzheimer disease.</p>
            <p>Familial Alzheimer disease accounts for a small minority of cases of Alzheimer disease, and genetic investigations suggest a role for amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its processing to amyloid β-protein (Aβ) peptides in the pathogenesis of these cases. The gene that encodes APP is on chromosome 21, and several forms of familial Alzheimer disease have been linked to mutations in the APP gene. These mutations lead to increased production of Aβ. Two other genetic loci linked to early-onset familial Alzheimer disease have been identified on chromosomes 14 and 1. They probably account for the majority of cases of early-onset familial Alzheimer disease. The genes on these two chromosomes encode highly related intracellular proteins: presenilin-1 and presenilin-2. Two mechanisms are proposed for the role of presenilins. First, mutations in the presenilins increase the production of Aβ, providing a genetic link for the deposition of amyloid. Second, the presenilins are also targets for cleavage by caspase proteases that are activated during apoptosis, suggesting a role for these proteins in neuronal cell death.</p>
            <p>One allele, E4, of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene on chromosome 19 increases the risk of Alzheimer disease and lowers the age of onset. The percentage of individuals with the E4 allele is high in populations of patients with Alzheimer disease compared with control populations. ApoE can bind Aβ and is present in plaques, but the manner in which this allele increases the risk for Alzheimer disease is unknown.</p>
            <p>The course of Alzheimer disease is slow but progressive, with a symptomatic period extending beyond 10 to 15 years. The early course of AD is difficult to determine because the patient is usually a poor historian and because the early signs may be so subtle that they evade the notice of family members. These early features include impaired memory, difficulty with problem solving, preoccupation with events long past, decreased spontaneity, and an inability to respond to the environment with the patient’s usual speed and accuracy. Patients may forget names, misplace household items, and forget what they were about to do. Often these individuals have insight into the memory deficits and occasionally relay their concerns to family members. Anomia, or difficulty with word finding, is common in the middle stage of Alzheimer disease. In the late stage of Alzheimer disease, physical and cognitive effects are marked. In the final stages, patients may become incontinent, mute, and unable to walk. Myoclonus with muscle tremors occasionally occurs. Mood disturbances such as depression are common. Alzheimer disease progresses at a slow pace to a state of complete helplessness. Intercurrent disease, often pneumonia, is usually the terminal event for these individuals.</p>
            <h4>Approach to Pick Disease</h4>
            <p>Pick disease is a rare, distinct progressive dementia with lobar atrophy. Clinically, the patient experiences behavioral changes with personality (frontal lobe signs) alterations and some language disturbances (temporal lobe signs). A brain with Pick disease shows cortical atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes. In addition to the localized cortical atrophy, there is often bilateral atrophy of the caudate nucleus and putamen. The cortical gyri can be reduced to a thin wafer-like appearance. This pattern of lobar atrophy is often prominent enough to distinguish Pick </p>
