                </ul>
                <p>Physiology is the science that explores how organisms, organs, cells, and molecules carry out the chemical and physical functions in a living system. The cornerstone of physiology is homeostasis, the ability of the body to maintain a stable internal environment. This is achieved through feedback mechanisms, primarily negative feedback loops, which counteract deviations from a set point. For example, blood glucose levels are tightly regulated by insulin and glucagon. Major organ systems, including the nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal systems, work in concert to maintain homeostasis. Disruptions in these systems can lead to disease states, such as diabetes or hypertension.</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 45-year-old male presents with excessive thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue. Blood tests reveal elevated glucose levels, and he is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. He reports a sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in refined sugars.</p>

                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Type 2 diabetes mellitus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Most likely etiology:</strong> Insulin resistance due to lifestyle factors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Likely physiological mechanism:</strong> Failure of negative feedback to regulate blood glucose levels.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 45-year-old male with symptoms of thirst, urination, and fatigue is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes due to insulin resistance.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Type 2 diabetes results from impaired insulin signaling, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. Normally, insulin facilitates glucose uptake into cells, but in insulin resistance, cells fail to respond adequately, disrupting homeostasis. This can lead to complications like cardiovascular disease if untreated. Lifestyle modifications and medications can help restore glucose regulation.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Muscle contraction occurs via the sliding filament theory, where actin and myosin filaments interact to shorten sarcomeres. Calcium, released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, binds to troponin, exposing myosin-binding sites on actin. ATP powers the cross-bridge cycle. Muscle fibers are classified as slow-twitch (type I) for endurance and fast-twitch (type II) for power. Skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles have distinct physiological properties.</p>

                    <li><strong>Excitation–Contraction (E–C) Coupling:</strong> The events that describe the calcium movements within the muscle fiber.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All muscle cells can be divided into striated and smooth based on their microscopic structure. Striated muscle includes skeletal, cardiac, and visceral subtypes, with skeletal muscle further classified as fast-twitch or slow-twitch based on contractile behavior and oxidative or glycolytic based on biochemical activities. Actin and myosin proteins form thin and thick filaments, respectively, arranged in sarcomeres, the functional units of striated muscle. Thin filaments extend from Z disks, and thick filaments overlap with them, enabling contraction via the sliding filament mechanism. Cross-bridges from myosin attach to actin, powered by ATP, causing filament sliding and muscle shortening without changing filament length. Skeletal muscle fibers, formed by the fusion of precursor cells, are multinucleated and arranged in parallel within muscles like the gastrocnemius, connected to tendons for movement or stabilization.</p>
                <p>Contraction depends on cytosolic calcium binding to troponin on thin filaments, initiating a conformational change that allows cross-bridge cycling. The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) stores and releases calcium during excitation, with calcium reuptake by an ATPase pump facilitating relaxation. Motor neurons release acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions, triggering action potentials that lead to calcium release. Muscle force is regulated by motor unit recruitment and activation frequency, with summation and tetanus increasing force through repeated stimulation. Isometric contractions generate force without shortening, while isotonic contractions involve shortening against a constant load. Fast-twitch fibers support rapid movements, while slow-twitch fibers are suited for endurance.</p>

                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Tetanus, caused by Clostridium tetani toxin, blocks inhibitory neurotransmitters like GABA, increasing motor neuron firing. This leads to sustained calcium release from the SR, prolonged troponin binding, and continuous muscle contraction (lockjaw, spasms). Antitoxin neutralizes unbound toxin, and wound debridement removes the infection source. Diazepam controls spasms, and airway protection is critical.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Smooth muscle is found in most organ systems (e.g., airways, arteries, intestines, uterus) and is classified as tonic (maintaining contraction) or phasic (periodic contraction). Unitary smooth muscle cells are coupled via gap junctions for synchronized contraction, while multiunit smooth muscle cells contract independently, similar to skeletal muscle. Actin and myosin form thin and thick filaments, but without sarcomere organization, giving a smooth appearance. Thin filaments attach to dense bodies, not Z disks, and have a higher thin-to-thick filament ratio (10:1) than skeletal muscle (2:1). Contraction follows the sliding filament model, driven by ATP via myosin ATPase, but is regulated by phosphorylation of myosin light chains by myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), activated by calcium–calmodulin complexes. Calcium levels increase upon stimulation, binding to calmodulin to initiate contraction, and decrease for relaxation via SR reuptake or extrusion. Smooth muscle excitation varies, with some cells showing rhythmic membrane potential fluctuations, others responding to hormones, paracrines, or stretch. Responses differ across organs, with some mediators causing contraction and others relaxation.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> An 8-year-old boy with bronchial constriction and anaphylaxis from a bee sting is treated with epinephrine.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Anaphylaxis, triggered by antigens like bee venom, causes cytokine release, leading to bronchial constriction, arteriolar dilation, and increased capillary permeability. This results in respiratory distress, urticaria, and potential shock. Epinephrine induces bronchial dilation (β-adrenergic) and vasoconstriction (α-adrenergic), relieving symptoms. Airway management is critical if edema occurs.</p>

                <p>The systemic vascular system includes large conducting arteries (e.g., aorta, carotids), arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins. Blood flow (Q) is driven by the pressure gradient (ΔP) divided by resistance (R): Q = ΔP ÷ R. Resistance is inversely proportional to vessel radius to the fourth power, making arterioles the primary resistance vessels due to their small radius, despite their large number reducing overall resistance. Velocity of blood flow is calculated as Velocity = Q ÷ A (cross-sectional area), with capillaries having the lowest velocity due to their large combined cross-sectional area, facilitating substance exchange. Large arteries have the highest velocity, but narrowing (e.g., atherosclerosis) increases velocity and can cause turbulent flow, detected as bruits. The Reynolds number (Re = D·v·ρ/η) predicts turbulence, increasing with velocity and vessel diameter. MAP (~100 mm Hg) drives flow, dropping to ~20 mm Hg in capillaries and ~5 mm Hg in veins. Pulse pressure (systolic minus diastolic) reflects stroke volume and vascular capacitance, which decreases with aging, increasing systolic pressure.</p>

                <p>Cardiac excitation begins at the SA node, spreading through atrial muscle, AV node, bundle of His, Purkinje fibers, and ventricular muscle via gap junctions. The AV node’s slow conduction (due to narrow fibers and lack of fast Na+ channels) delays ventricular contraction, allowing atrial filling. Purkinje fibers conduct rapidly, ensuring synchronous ventricular contraction. Fast action potentials in atrial and ventricular muscle rely on Na+ influx, with a plateau phase driven by Ca2+ influx (L-type channels) for contraction. SA and AV nodal cells use slow Ca2+-dependent action potentials. The SA node’s pacemaker potential involves a hyperpolarization-activated “funny” current (If), slow K+ channel closing, and Ca2+ channel activation. Sympathetic stimulation (norepinephrine) increases heart rate via β-receptors, enhancing If and Ca2+ currents. Parasympathetic stimulation (acetylcholine) slows heart rate by hyperpolarizing nodal cells and reducing Ca2+ influx.</p>

                <p>The electrocardiogram (ECG) records extracellular signals from synchronous cardiac action potentials using 12 leads: six limb leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) for the frontal plane and six precordial leads (V1–V6) for the transverse plane. The P wave reflects atrial depolarization, the QRS complex ventricular depolarization, and the T wave ventricular repolarization. The PR interval represents AV node conduction time, prolonged in first-degree heart block. Second-degree heart block shows more P waves than QRS complexes, and third-degree heart block shows independent P and QRS complexes. Hypertrophy shifts the mean electrical axis, determined by QRS complex magnitude. Acute myocardial infarction causes ST-segment elevation or depression due to injury currents from partial depolarization in the affected region.</p>

                <p>Cardiac muscle, like skeletal muscle, is striated and calcium-regulated but has smaller, branched fibers electrically coupled via gap junctions. Excitation–contraction coupling involves action potential propagation through gap junctions, with Ca2+ influx via L-type channels triggering further Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium binds to troponin-C, initiating contraction. Calcium is reuptaken by the SR or extruded via Na+-Ca2+ exchange. The Starling law governs force via the length–tension relationship, where optimal fiber length (Lo) maximizes cross-bridge interactions. Contractility, modulated by sympathetic (β-adrenergic, increasing Ca2+ via cAMP) and parasympathetic (muscarinic, decreasing Ca2+ via cAMP inhibition) inputs, alters force independently of length. The cardiac cycle includes atrial systole (P wave, fourth heart sound), isovolumetric ventricular contraction (QRS, first heart sound), rapid and reduced ventricular ejection, isovolumetric relaxation (second heart sound), and rapid and reduced ventricular filling (third heart sound).</p>

                <p>Venous return and cardiac output (CO) are equal in a steady state, determined by the interplay of cardiac and vascular function. The Frank–Starling relationship shows that CO increases with VP due to greater cardiac muscle stretch, enhancing contraction force (Figure 12-1). Cardiac function curves reflect CO dependence on VP, influenced by heart rate, myocardial contractility, TPR, and intrathoracic pressure. Vascular function curves show VP dependence on CO, with mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP) at zero CO determined by blood volume and venous smooth muscle contraction. Increased blood volume or venous contraction raises MCFP, shifting the vascular function curve rightward, increasing VP and CO. Increased TPR reduces VP for a given CO, rotating the vascular function curve counterclockwise, reducing CO (Figure 12-3). The equilibrium point where cardiac and vascular function curves intersect defines the steady-state CO and VP.</p>

                <p>MAP is determined by TPR × CO. TPR arises from small arteries and arterioles, contracted by norepinephrine, epinephrine, angiotensin II, and ADH. The baroreceptor reflex, involving carotid sinus and aortic arch stretch receptors, rapidly adjusts CO and TPR via sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Sympathetic stimulation increases heart rate, contractility, and TPR, while parasympathetic stimulation reduces heart rate. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system provides slower regulation. Renin, released from the juxtaglomerular apparatus in response to low pressure or sympathetic stimulation, cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, converted to angiotensin II by ACE. Angiotensin II constricts arterioles (increasing TPR) and stimulates aldosterone release, increasing sodium and water reabsorption, expanding blood volume, and raising MAP.</p>

                <p>Blood flow matches organ metabolic demand via intrinsic (local metabolites like CO2, K+, H+, adenosine) and extrinsic (sympathetic nerves, hormones) controls. Local flow = MAP ÷ local resistance. Autoregulation maintains constant flow in organs like the brain despite MAP changes. Active hyperemia increases flow with metabolic activity, reducing local resistance. Reactive hyperemia follows ischemia, driven by metabolite accumulation. Sympathetic innervation varies by organ, with skin, intestine, and kidney having dense innervation, overridden during baroreceptor reflex to maintain MAP. Capillary exchange involves diffusion of small molecules and bulk flow per the Starling equation: Jv = Kf [(Pc − PIF) − (πc − πIF)]. Increased venous pressure or hypoalbuminemia increases filtration, leading to edema if lymphatic drainage is overwhelmed.</p>

                <p>The lungs’ 300 million alveoli facilitate gas exchange, with ventilation and perfusion matched for efficiency. Tidal volume (~500 mL) is measured by spirometry, along with inspiratory and expiratory reserve volumes and VC. FRC, residual volume (RV), and TLC require inert gas techniques. FRC reflects lung and chest wall elastic recoil balance. Airway resistance, primarily in medium-sized bronchi, is inversely proportional to radius^4. Pulmonary circulation has lower pressures (~1/10 systemic), with non-uniform flow due to gravity. Capillary filtration, driven by hydrostatic and oncotic pressures, is normally balanced by lymphatic drainage. Pulmonary edema from increased capillary pressure (e.g., heart failure) or permeability (e.g., ARDS) disrupts gas exchange, causing hypoxia.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>FRC is determined by lung inward and chest wall outward elastic recoil, creating subatmospheric intrapleural pressure. Inspiration, driven by diaphragm and external intercostal contraction, lowers intrapleural pressure, expanding alveoli. Expiration is passive during rest, driven by lung recoil. Deep breathing involves scalene, sternomastoids, and abdominal muscles. Lung compliance, inversely related to elastic recoil, depends on surface tension and interdependence. Surfactant reduces surface tension, preventing alveolar collapse per Laplace’s law. Interdependence stabilizes alveoli via structural connections. Decreased compliance (e.g., surfactant deficiency) reduces FRC; increased compliance (e.g., emphysema) increases FRC.</p>

                <p>Lung compliance, influenced by elastic tissue and surfactant, affects FRC. Emphysema increases compliance, raising FRC, while fibrosis decreases it. Dynamic compression during forced expiration, exacerbated in emphysema, limits airflow due to airway collapse. Nonrespiratory lung functions include mucociliary transport, macrophage and immune defense, and metabolic activity (e.g., angiotensin I to II conversion, inactivation of serotonin, bradykinin). Surfactant contains antioxidants like glutathione to protect against reactive oxygen species.</p>

                    <li><strong>Restrictive Disease:</strong> Disorders impairing lung expansion.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Pulmonary function tests measure airflow velocity and lung volumes to distinguish obstructive from restrictive lung diseases. Obstructive diseases increase airflow resistance, while restrictive diseases limit lung expansion. Mechanical factors include airway resistance, lung and chest wall elastic recoil, and respiratory muscle strength. Lung volumes, measured via spirometry, include tidal volume (TV, ~500 mL) and functional residual capacity (FRC, ~2300 mL), dependent on chest wall outward and lung inward recoil. Compliance (Δvolume/Δpressure) is inversely related to elasticity; fibrotic lungs have low compliance, reducing FRC. Gas exchange follows Fick’s law, dependent on surface area, barrier thickness, gas diffusion coefficient, and concentration gradient. Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) is perfusion-limited, equilibrating in ~0.1 s, while carbon monoxide (CO) is diffusion-limited due to hemoglobin binding. Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is normally perfusion-limited but can become diffusion-limited in conditions like pulmonary fibrosis, where thickened alveolar-capillary barriers reduce O<sub>2</sub> exchange, causing hypoxemia.</p>

                <p>Oxygen is primarily transported bound to hemoglobin (~19.6 mL/100 mL blood at 97.5% saturation), with minimal dissolved O<sub>2</sub> (0.3 mL/100 mL). Hemoglobin’s tetrameric structure yields a sigmoidal O<sub>2</sub> dissociation curve, modulated by pH, CO<sub>2</sub>, temperature, and 2,3-DPG, which shift the curve right, reducing O<sub>2</sub> affinity (Bohr effect). CO<sub>2</sub> is transported as bicarbonate (~2/3), dissolved, or bound to hemoglobin (carbamino groups). Carbonic anhydrase in red cells catalyzes CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇌ H<sup>+</sup> + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, with HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchanged for Cl<sup>-</sup>. Deoxygenation enhances CO<sub>2</sub> binding (Haldane effect).

                <p>Renal autoregulation maintains renal blood flow and GFR via myogenic mechanisms (afferent arteriole stretch receptors) and tubuloglomerular feedback (macula densa sensing chloride delivery). Hypovolemia reduces renal perfusion, triggering renin release, forming angiotensin II, which vasoconstricts arterioles, increases TPR, and stimulates aldosterone, enhancing sodium/water reabsorption. Sympathetic activation constricts arterioles, reducing GFR and urine output. ADH increases water reabsorption in collecting ducts. GFR is estimated clinically via creatinine clearance or plasma creatinine/BUN levels.</p>

                    <li><strong>Loop Diuretic:</strong> A diuretic that inhibits the Na-K-Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, e.g., furosemide.</li>
                    <li><strong>Potassium-Sparing Diuretic:</strong> A diuretic that inhibits sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion in the late distal tubule and cortical collecting duct, preventing potassium loss.</li>

                <p>Of the 30% to 40% of filtered fluid not reabsorbed by the proximal tubule, most is reabsorbed by the loop of Henle, distal tubule, and collecting duct, with less than 1%-2% excreted as urine to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. The loop of Henle, comprising thin descending, thin ascending, and thick ascending limbs, reabsorbs 25% to 30% of filtered NaCl, primarily in the thick ascending limb, with minimal water, creating a hypertonic medullary interstitium via the countercurrent multiplier system. This system relies on high water permeability in the descending limb, high NaCl permeability in the thin ascending limb, and active NaCl reabsorption with low water permeability in the thick ascending limb. The Na-K-Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb drives this process, with furosemide inhibiting it, reducing NaCl and water reabsorption, leading to diuresis. In the distal convoluted tubule, NaCl is reabsorbed via a thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter. In the late distal tubule and cortical collecting duct, sodium is reabsorbed via epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) and extruded by Na-K-ATPase, with potassium secreted via luminal K+ channels. Aldosterone enhances Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion by increasing Na+ channels, Na-K-ATPase, and Krebs cycle enzyme activity, with effects delayed by protein synthesis.</p>

                <p>Body fluid osmolality is regulated by ADH, which controls water reabsorption in the collecting ducts. ADH binds to V2 receptors on principal cells, activating adenylyl cyclase and cAMP, leading to protein kinase A phosphorylation of aquaporin 2 channels, which insert into the luminal membrane, increasing water permeability. Water is reabsorbed passively into the hypertonic interstitium, reducing urine volume and increasing osmolality (up to 1200–1400 mOsmol/kg with high ADH). Without ADH, low water permeability results in copious dilute urine (50–60 mOsmol/kg). ADH secretion is stimulated by hyperosmolality (via hypothalamic osmoreceptors) and hypovolemia (via atrial and carotid sinus receptors). Free-water clearance (CH2O = V − COsm) quantifies water excretion or retention, with positive values for hypotonic urine and negative for hypertonic urine.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>ECF volume is proportional to sodium stores, regulated by the kidneys via sodium reabsorption. The proximal tubule reabsorbs 60–70% of filtered sodium via Na+-H+ exchange and Na+-glucose cotransport, with water following osmotically. The thick ascending limb reabsorbs 25% of NaCl via the Na-K-Cl cotransporter, contributing to medullary hypertonicity. The distal convoluted tubule uses a thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter, while the cortical collecting duct reabsorbs Na+ via ENaC, regulated by aldosterone. In hypovolemia, sympathetic activation, ADH, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system enhance Na+ and water retention. In hypervolemia, reduced sympathetic activity, ADH, and aldosterone increase Na+ excretion. In hypoalbuminemia (e.g., cirrhosis), low plasma oncotic pressure causes edema, but low plasma volume triggers Na+ retention.</p>

                <p>Potassium (98% intracellular) is regulated by Na-K-ATPase, with ECF levels (3.5–5.0 mEq/L) maintained by renal excretion. Proximal tubule and thick ascending limb reabsorb most filtered K+, while the cortical collecting duct secretes K+ via luminal channels, driven by aldosterone, plasma K+, and flow rate. ACE inhibitors reduce aldosterone, decreasing K+ secretion, causing hyperkalemia. Acidosis increases ECF K+ by H+-K+ exchange. Calcium is mostly stored in bone, with 99% of filtered calcium reabsorbed, primarily in the proximal tubule (65%) and thick ascending limb (25%), regulated by PTH and calcitonin. Magnesium (54% in bone, 45% intracellular) is reabsorbed mainly in the thick ascending limb (70%), influenced by PTH and a calcium-sensing receptor, with calcium and magnesium competing for reabsorption.</p>

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pH = pKa + log([HCO3−]/[CO2])) shows pH depends on the HCO3−/CO2 ratio. In metabolic acidosis, reduced HCO3− lowers pH, compensated by hyperventilation to reduce PCO2. Kidneys excrete H+ as ammonia or titratable acids, generating HCO3−. In respiratory alkalosis, low PCO2 raises pH, with kidneys reducing H+ secretion and HCO3− reabsorption. Anion gap ([Na+] − ([Cl−] + [HCO3−])) identifies acidosis causes like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Neurocrine:</strong> An endogenous chemical released from nerve endings to act on cells innervated by those nerves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Endocrine:</strong> An endogenous chemical released from endocrine cells into the circulation to act on distant cells that possess receptors for that chemical.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The GI tract functions as a food-processing system, breaking down complex foodstuffs into simpler molecules for absorption. Each organ contributes to secretory, digestive, absorptive, and motility processes, regulated by chemical and mechanical receptors. These initiate neurocrine (e.g., acetylcholine [ACh]), endocrine (e.g., gastrin, CCK), and paracrine (e.g., histamine, somatostatin) responses. The cephalic phase, triggered by the sight, smell, and taste of food, involves vagal reflexes releasing ACh and gastrin, stimulating salivary, gastric, and pancreatic secretions. The gastric phase, activated by food in the stomach, enhances acid and pepsin secretion via ACh, gastrin, and histamine from enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, with somatostatin inhibiting gastrin at low pH. The intestinal phase, initiated by gastric emptying, involves secretin (stimulating pancreatic HCO3− secretion), CCK (inducing pancreatic enzyme secretion, gallbladder contraction, and gastric relaxation), and GIP/GLP (enhancing insulin release). The interdigestive state features migrating motor complexes (MMCs) initiated by motilin. Other mediators like VIP, serotonin, and NO regulate motility and secretion.</p>

                <h3>28.2 Clinical Case: Cholecystitis</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 43-year-old woman presents with acute right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain radiating to the right shoulder, nausea, vomiting, and no fever. Pain worsens after fatty meals. Examination shows RUQ tenderness, elevated white blood cell count, liver function tests, and alkaline phosphatase, with normal amylase and lipase. Ultrasound reveals gallstones and gallbladder wall thickening, leading to a cholecystectomy.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Effect of fatty foods on gallstones:</strong> Fatty foods stimulate CCK secretion, causing gallbladder contraction and sphincter of Oddi relaxation. Gallstones obstruct bile outflow, increasing pain.</li>
                    <li><strong>CCK and gastric emptying:</strong> Delays gastric emptying to allow more time for fat digestion.</li>
                    <li><strong>CCK and gastrin:</strong> Shares five C-terminal amino acids with gastrin, where biologic activity resides.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 43-year-old woman with gallstones and acute cholecystitis has RUQ pain exacerbated by fatty foods, treated with cholecystectomy.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Cholelithiasis is more common in females and increases with age. Symptomatic gallstones cause biliary colic, RUQ pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Ultrasound confirms gallstones. Treatment includes NPO status, antibiotics, and avoiding morphine (which constricts the sphincter of Oddi). Low-fat diets reduce CCK secretion in asymptomatic cases.</p>

                    <li><strong>Segmenting contractions:</strong> Contractions in the small and large intestine (haustral contractions in colon) that mix and circulate contents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Peristaltic contractions:</strong> Contractions propelling contents forward throughout the GI tract.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>GI motility involves coordinated muscle contractions to move food through the tract. Striated muscle in the pharynx, upper esophagus, and external anal sphincter is controlled by extrinsic nerves. Smooth muscle, found elsewhere, is regulated by enteric nerves in the myenteric plexus, influenced by extrinsic nerves and hormones. Tonic contractions maintain closure in sphincters (e.g., LES, UES), while phasic contractions drive mixing and propulsion. Swallowing involves a reflex coordinating peristalsis and sphincter relaxation. Gastric motility includes receptive relaxation and peristaltic mixing. Small intestine segmenting contractions mix contents, while peristaltic contractions propel them. Colonic haustral contractions aid absorption, and mass movements drive defecation. MMCs, initiated by motilin, clear the stomach and small intestine during fasting. Neurotransmitters like ACh (excitatory), NO, VIP, and ATP (inhibitory) regulate motility, with CCK and motilin playing key hormonal roles.</p>

                <p>Salivary glands secrete hypotonic fluid rich in potassium and bicarbonate, containing amylase, lipase, and mucus, regulated by autonomic nerves. Gastric parietal cells secrete HCl via H+-K+-ATPase, activated by ACh, histamine, and gastrin, with intrinsic factor for vitamin B12 absorption. Chief cells secrete pepsinogen, converted to pepsin by acid. Somatostatin inhibits gastrin at low pH. Pancreatic acinar cells secrete enzymes (e.g., lipase, amylase) in response to CCK and ACh, while duct cells secrete bicarbonate in response to secretin. Hepatocytes secrete bile acids, phospholipids, and cholesterol, concentrated in the gallbladder. CCK drives gallbladder contraction and sphincter of Oddi relaxation, aiding lipid digestion via enterohepatic circulation.</p>

                <p>Carbohydrates (starches, disaccharides) are digested by salivary and pancreatic amylase into maltose, maltotriose, and a-dextrins, further hydrolyzed by brush border enzymes (a-dextrinase, maltase-glucoamylase, sucrase-isomaltase, lactase) into glucose, galactose, and fructose. Glucose and galactose are absorbed via SGLT-1 (sodium-coupled), fructose via GLUT-5 (facilitated diffusion). Proteins are digested by gastric pepsin and pancreatic proteases (e.g., trypsin) into amino acids, di-, and tripeptides, absorbed via sodium-coupled and peptide transporters. Lipids (triglycerides, phospholipids) are emulsified in the stomach, digested by pancreatic lipase and phospholipases, and absorbed as fatty acids, monoglycerides, and lysophospholipids via micelles. Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) are absorbed via micelles; water-soluble vitamins (B1, B2, C, etc.) via sodium-coupled transport, except B12, which requires intrinsic factor and ileal uptake.</p>

                <p>The small intestine absorbs ~9 L of water and 30 g of sodium daily, with the colon absorbing 1–2 L. Water moves passively to maintain isosmotic conditions. Villus cells absorb sodium via sodium-coupled transport (sugars, amino acids), Na+-Cl− cotransport, Na+-H+ countertransport, and restricted diffusion, powered by Na+-K+-ATPase. Chloride and water follow passively. Potassium is absorbed passively in the small intestine and actively in the colon via K+-H+-ATPase. Crypt cells secrete chloride via a Na+-K+-Cl− cotransporter, with sodium and water following, regulated by cAMP and calcium. Bicarbonate secretion in the colon exchanges with chloride, making fecal fluid alkaline. Diarrhea increases potassium and bicarbonate loss, causing hypokalemia and acidosis.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>The pituitary gland, composed of anterior and posterior lobes, is a key regulator of endocrine functions, controlled largely by the hypothalamus. The posterior pituitary releases antidiuretic hormone (ADH, vasopressin) and oxytocin, synthesized in hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, transported via axons, and stored in nerve endings until released. ADH secretion responds to osmoreceptors and cardiovascular volume receptors, while oxytocin is triggered by cervical stretch or suckling. The anterior pituitary secretes growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and prolactin (PRL), synthesized in pituitary cells and regulated by hypothalamic peptides via the hypothalamohypophysial portal system. GH is stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and inhibited by somatostatin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). TSH is driven by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) with feedback inhibition by thyroid hormones (T3, T4). FSH and LH require pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, modulated by sex steroids. ACTH is stimulated by corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) with cortisol feedback inhibition. PRL is tonically inhibited by dopamine, stimulated by TRH, and rises during pregnancy and nursing, suppressing GnRH and the menstrual cycle.</p>

                <p>A 44-year-old woman presents with 8 months of amenorrhea, negative pregnancy tests, daily headaches, visual changes, and milky breast discharge. Physical exam reveals galactorrhea and diminished peripheral vision bilaterally.

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 44-year-old woman with secondary amenorrhea, galactorrhea, headaches, visual changes, and hyperprolactinemia is diagnosed with a pituitary prolactinoma.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Hyperprolactinemia can result from pregnancy, hypothyroidism, medications (e.g., antipsychotics, metoclopramide), or prolactinomas. Symptoms include amenorrhea (via GnRH inhibition) and galactorrhea. Prolactinomas may cause headaches and bitemporal hemianopia due to optic chiasm compression. Normally, prolactin stimulates hypothalamic dopamine, inhibiting its own secretion, but adenomas disrupt this feedback. Microadenomas are treated medically with dopamine agonists (e.g., bromocriptine); symptomatic or unresponsive cases and macroadenomas often require surgery.</p>

                <p>Thyroid follicles consist of epithelial cells surrounding a lumen containing thyroglobulin, synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and secreted into the lumen. Iodide is actively transported into follicular cells, oxidized by thyroperoxidase, and coupled to thyroglobulin tyrosines to form mono- and diiodotyrosines, yielding T4 (major) and T3 (minor). Thyroglobulin is endocytosed, hydrolyzed, and T3/T4 are released into circulation. TSH, stimulated by hypothalamic TRH, enhances synthesis and secretion via cAMP signaling. In Graves disease, TSH receptor antibodies drive hormone production, bypassing T3/T4 feedback inhibition at the pituitary. T3/T4 bind tightly to plasma proteins (e.g., thyroxin-binding globulin), with <1% free; T4 is converted to T3 (active form) in tissues. Thyroid hormones increase metabolism (except in brain, testis, spleen), enhancing oxygen consumption, ATP production, and heat generation. They upregulate carbohydrate absorption, glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and modulate lipid/protein metabolism. Thyroid hormones are critical for perinatal brain development, increase adrenergic receptors, and support growth hormone effects on skeletal growth.</p>

                <p>The adrenal glands, located above the kidneys, consist of an outer cortex and inner medulla. The cortex has three zones: zona glomerulosa (produces aldosterone), zona fasciculata, and zona reticularis (produce glucocorticoids and androgens). The medulla secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine. Glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol) and androgens are regulated by ACTH, which binds cell surface receptors to stimulate pregnenolone synthesis, the precursor for adrenal steroids. ACTH, driven by hypothalamic CRH, follows a diurnal rhythm, peaking in the morning, with cortisol exerting negative feedback on ACTH and CRH. Cortisol enhances gluconeogenesis, proteolysis, and lipolysis, maintaining energy balance during fasting, and has anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. It also suppresses cytokine production (e.g., IL-1, TNF-α), inhibiting immune responses. Aldosterone, regulated by angiotensin II, potassium, and atrial natriuretic factor, promotes renal sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion, maintaining fluid balance. Adrenal steroids bind nuclear receptors to modulate gene transcription.</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 36-year-old woman presents with amenorrhea, hirsutism, weight gain (truncal), and fatigue. Examination shows a round face, centripetal obesity, hypertension, abdominal striae, and male-pattern hair. Labs reveal increased cortisol and failure to suppress cortisol with dexamethasone, leading to a diagnosis of Cushing syndrome.</p>

                    <li><strong>Cortisol production:</strong> Zona fasciculata.</li>
                    <li><strong>Glucocorticoids and prostaglandins:</strong> Inhibit cyclooxygenase and phospholipase A2, reducing prostaglandin formation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hyperpigmentation in secondary adrenocortical insufficiency:</strong> Low ACTH (no MSH fragment) prevents hyperpigmentation, unlike primary insufficiency.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 36-year-old woman with Cushing syndrome has amenorrhea, hirsutism, obesity, and elevated cortisol.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Cushing syndrome results from excess cortisol, often due to ACTH overproduction (Cushing disease) or adrenal hyperplasia. Symptoms include truncal obesity, moon face, buffalo hump, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. Diagnosis involves elevated cortisol and dexamethasone suppression failure. ACTH levels distinguish pituitary (high) from adrenal (low) causes. Treatment includes surgery for ACTH-secreting tumors or medical management (e.g., ketoconazole) for adrenal hyperplasia.</p>

                <p>The pancreatic islets of Langerhans secrete insulin (beta cells), glucagon (alpha cells), and somatostatin (delta cells), delivered to the liver via the portal vein. Insulin secretion is triggered by elevated plasma glucose, increasing ATP, closing KATP channels, depolarizing the membrane, and opening voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, leading to vesicle fusion. Sulfonylureas enhance this by blocking KATP channels. Amino acids, fatty acids, and incretins (GIP, GLP-1) also stimulate insulin, while epinephrine and somatostatin inhibit it. Insulin promotes glucose uptake (muscle, adipose), glycogen synthesis, and lipogenesis in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue via tyrosine kinase receptors. Glucagon, stimulated by low glucose, epinephrine, and acetylcholine, activates hepatic G protein-coupled receptors, increasing cAMP and promoting glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis. Somatostatin inhibits both insulin and glucagon secretion, possibly via paracrine effects. Plasma glucose tightly regulates insulin (increases with high glucose) and glucagon (increases with low glucose), balancing hepatic glucose uptake and production.</p>

                <p>Body fuel reserves include glycogen (liver, muscle), fats (adipose, liver), and proteins (muscle), with fat yielding 9.4 kcal/g and carbohydrate/protein 4.2 kcal/g. Plasma glucose (80-90 mg/dL) is maintained by insulin (anabolic, promotes storage) and glucagon (catabolic, promotes production), primarily acting on the liver. After meals, high glucose stimulates insulin, driving hepatic glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, and lipogenesis, and glucose uptake in muscle/adipose. Low glucose increases glucagon, promoting hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Adipose tissue lipolysis, regulated by hormone-sensitive lipase, releases free fatty acids (FFA) in low insulin states, inhibited by insulin. Muscle glycogenolysis supports local oxidation, not blood glucose, and is insulin-dependent at rest but not during exercise. Fasting depletes glycogen in 1-2 days, shifting to FFA oxidation and protein catabolism for gluconeogenesis, driven by glucagon, cortisol, and catecholamines. Cortisol enhances enzyme expression for fuel mobilization. Exercise increases glucagon, catecholamines, and cortisol, reducing insulin, promoting hepatic glucose production and FFA mobilization.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>PTH:</strong> A hormone that plays a critical role in controlling calcium and phosphate balance.</li>
                    <li><strong>1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol):</strong> The most active form of vitamin D.</li>
                    <li><strong>25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol):</strong> An inactive form of vitamin D.</li>
                    <li><strong>1α-hydroxylase:</strong> The enzyme that converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Calcium is essential for muscle contraction, hormone secretion, cell proliferation, and gene expression, with ~99.9% stored in bone (~1000 g) and ~0.1% in extracellular fluid (~1 g). Plasma ionized calcium and phosphate are tightly regulated by PTH and vitamin D, with calcitonin and estrogens playing secondary roles. PTH, a peptide hormone from parathyroid chief cells, is stimulated by low plasma calcium via the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G protein-coupled receptor. High calcium activates phospholipase C, increasing IP3 and DAG, elevating intracellular calcium and activating protein kinase C, inhibiting PTH secretion. PTH raises plasma calcium by enhancing intestinal calcium absorption (via increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), stimulating bone resorption, and promoting renal calcium reabsorption in the distal tubule. Vitamin D, synthesized in skin or ingested, is hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by 1α-hydroxylase, stimulated by PTH and low phosphate. Vitamin D enhances intestinal calcium absorption via calcium channels and calbindin, synergizes with PTH for renal calcium reabsorption, and promotes bone resorption and mineralization. Calcitonin, from thyroid C cells, is released with high calcium, inhibiting osteoclast bone resorption and causing mild renal calciuresis, but its role in humans is unclear, as thyroidectomy or C-cell tumors show normal calcium levels.</p>

                <h3>38.2 Clinical Case: Hyperparathyroidism</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 70-year-old woman presents with right flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and hematuria. She has recurrent kidney stones, abdominal pain, muscle weakness, and atrophy. Examination shows moderate distress, fragility, and right back pain. Urinalysis reveals hematuria without infection, and an intravenous pyelogram shows numerous kidney stones. Labs indicate hypercalcemia, leading to a diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism from a parathyroid adenoma.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>PTH and intestinal calcium absorption:</strong> Increases absorption by increasing production of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1α-hydroxylase activity).</li>
                    <li><strong>Elevated PTH and phosphate:</strong> Inhibits renal phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule, increasing excretion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Factors increasing 1α-hydroxylase activity:</strong> Increased PTH, decreased serum calcium, and decreased phosphate levels.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 70-year-old woman with kidney stones, abdominal pain, and muscle weakness is diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Hypercalcemia can result from increased absorption (milk-alkali syndrome), reduced excretion (thiazides), bone mobilization (hyperparathyroidism), or metastatic cancer (breast, prostate). Symptoms range from asymptomatic (mild) to constipation, nausea, nephrolithiasis, renal failure, confusion, or coma (severe). Hyperparathyroidism is often due to a parathyroid adenoma, treated surgically or with calcimimetics.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Growth hormone (GH), a 191-amino acid peptide (~22 kDa), is synthesized by anterior pituitary somatotrophs, stored in vesicles, and released upon stimulation. GH binds to tyrosine kinase-associated receptors, inducing dimerization and activating JAK-2, which phosphorylates receptors, triggering STAT and MAP kinase pathways. These activate transcription factors, producing insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1, IGF-2). IGF-1, structurally similar to insulin, is synthesized mainly in the liver and acts via tyrosine kinase receptors. GH is stabilized by GH-binding protein, derived from receptor cleavage. GH promotes anabolism, increasing protein/RNA synthesis, lipolysis in adipose tissue, and gluconeogenesis/amino acid uptake in liver/muscle. Indirect effects via IGFs drive bone elongation, targeting epiphyseal plate chondrocytes for cartilage matrix production, calcification, and bone formation. GH secretion is pulsatile, peaking in early morning and during puberty, regulated by hypothalamic GHRH (stimulates) and somatostatin (inhibits), with IGF-1 exerting negative feedback. Somatostatin reduces pituitary GHRH response, and somatomedins (IGFs) stimulate somatostatin production, inhibiting GH.</p>

                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> GH overproduction in childhood causes gigantism; in adolescence, acromegaly. Gigantism features excessive height, coarse features, and soft tissue growth. Acromegaly thickens bones (e.g., cranium, mandible) post-epiphyseal closure. Treatment uses somatostatin analogs. GH deficiency in childhood causes pituitary dwarfism, with normal early growth but stunted later development.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Testes contain seminiferous tubules (Sertoli and germ cells for spermatogenesis) and interstitial connective tissue (Leydig cells). Sertoli cells isolate developing sperm, secrete fluid for transport, and produce androgen-binding protein/growth factors. Leydig cells secrete testosterone (>95% of total), synthesized from cholesterol via pregnenolone. Testosterone, mostly bound to albumin or sex hormone-binding protein, acts paracrinely on Sertoli cells and endocrinically on distant tissues. Spermatogenesis requires pulsatile hypothalamic GnRH, stimulating pituitary LH (acts on Leydig cells for testosterone) and FSH (acts on Sertoli cells). Testosterone and FSH synergize to drive sperm development; inhibin from Sertoli cells inhibits FSH. Testosterone feedback reduces GnRH/LH. At puberty, nocturnal GnRH/LH/FSH pulses increase, driving testosterone secretion. Testosterone, often converted to DHT by 5α-reductase, promotes male secondary sex organs, hair growth, muscle mass, vocal changes, skeletal growth, epiphyseal closure, and libido. In androgen insensitivity (defective androgen receptors), wolffian ducts atrophy, and antimüllerian hormone from testes prevents müllerian structure development.</p>

                <p>Ovaries, attached by utero-ovarian and infundibulopelvic ligaments, have a medullary support zone (vessels, nerves) and cortical functional zone (follicles, corpora lutea). Primordial follicles develop into primary, secondary, tertiary, and graafian follicles, with most becoming atretic. Granulosa cells (surround oocyte) and thecal cells (outer layers) synthesize estradiol; thecal cells produce androgens, converted to estradiol by granulosa cell aromatase. Post-ovulation, granulosa cells luteinize into corpus luteum, secreting progesterone. Ovarian function is driven by pituitary FSH and LH, regulated by pulsatile hypothalamic GnRH. FSH recruits primary follicles; LH supports dominant follicle development and ovulation via a preovulatory surge. Estradiol from follicles suppresses FSH (negative feedback) and triggers LH surge (positive feedback). Progesterone from corpus luteum reduces LH pulse frequency. The 28-day menstrual cycle includes a follicular phase (estradiol-driven, variable length) and luteal phase (progesterone-driven, ~14 days). The endometrium proliferates (follicular) and becomes secretory (luteal), shedding with progesterone withdrawal.</p>

                <p>Fertilization occurs in the oviduct’s ampulla, where capacitated sperm penetrate the ovum’s cumulus matrix and zona pellucida, triggering ovum activation and embryo development. Capacitation enhances sperm motility and acrosome reaction, releasing acrosin to penetrate the zona. The blastocyst reaches the uterus ~6 days post-ovulation, hatches from the zona, and implants ~day 7 via apposition, adhesion, and penetration into the endometrium. Trophoblastic cells drive implantation, forming cytotrophoblasts (mitotic) and syncytiotrophoblasts (secretory). The placenta secretes hCG, maintaining the corpus luteum’s progesterone production until ~8-10 weeks, when the placenta takes over. Progesterone supports uterine growth, inhibits contractility, and prevents immune rejection. Estrogens (from syncytiotrophoblasts) enhance blood flow and mammary development. hCG peaks at 10 weeks, enabling pregnancy detection. Lactation is inhibited during pregnancy by high estrogen/progesterone, despite rising prolactin. Post-parturition, estrogen decline allows prolactin-driven milk synthesis, sustained by suckling, which also triggers oxytocin for milk letdown and suppresses ovulation via prolactin’s inhibition of GnRH.</p>

                <p>An often neglected but important part of a physical examination is the eye examination. A thorough eye examination can identify and localize many disease processes. Tumors or ischemic events may affect various nerve tracts, including the optic nerve tract. Depending on the location of the lesion, a predictable visual change can be recognized on the basis of knowledge of the optic tract. Lesions that affect the optic chiasm affect both of the peripheral visual fields, sparing the midline visual fields. An example of this type of lesion would be a pituitary tumor that compresses the optic chiasm. A lesion in an optic nerve will result in blindness in the ipsilateral eye, and a lesion in an optic tract will result in homonymous hemianopia. Pupil size and retinal changes also can reflect underlying medical conditions.</p>

                <h3>Discussion</h3>
                <p>Light enters the pupil and passes through the lens, the vitreous humor, and the inner layers of the retina before encountering photopigment molecules in the outer segments of cone or rod photoreceptors. In each case the chromophore is 11-cis retinal (derived from vitamin A), which absorbs a photon to isomerize to all-trans-retinal. In rods the chromophore is attached to the protein opsin (forming rhodopsin), and in cones the same chromophore is attached to one of three different cone opsins that alter the absorbance spectrum of the chromophore so that it is most sensitive to short (blue-violet), medium (green-yellow), or long (yellow-red) wavelengths. Transition to the all-trans form of retinal causes a conformational change in the opsin (this semi-stable conformation is called metarhodopsin II in rods) that activates the G protein transducin, which then activates a phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).</p>
                <p>Sensory transduction in the retina is unusual because the effective stimulus, light, does not excite photoreceptors; instead it hyperpolarizes them. In the dark, cGMP is synthesized continuously by a constitutively active guanylyl cyclase, and the resulting cGMP binds to and opens cGMP-activated cation channels, causing an influx of Na+ that maintains the photoreceptor at a depolarized potential (~ −40 mV). The tonic depolarization causes a continuous release of glutamate from the photoreceptor’s terminals onto bipolar cells. During illumination, the decrease in cGMP reduces the opening of cGMP-activated cation channels, causing the photoreceptor to hyperpolarize and reducing tonic release of glutamate onto bipolar cells. Bipolar cells in the “off” channel have ionotropic glutamate receptors that depolarize the cell in the presence of glutamate and hyperpolarize the cell when glutamate release from the photoreceptors decreases in response to light. Bipolar cells in the “on” channel have metabotropic glutamate receptors that hyperpolarize the cell in the presence of glutamate; therefore, light causes a depolarizing response in these cells, inverting the signal from inhibitory to excitatory. These on and off responses are maintained through much of the subsequent visual pathway.</p>
                <p>The bipolar cells excite ganglion cells in the retina, and the ganglion cells send long axons through the optic nerve, optic chiasm, and optic tract to excite neurons in the lateral geniculate body; those axons then project to the primary visual cortex. At each level from the retina to the visual cortex, the visual information is sharpened by center versus surround inhibition mediated by local inhibitory interneurons such as the horizontal cells in the retina. In the optic chiasm, ganglion cell axons from the nasal half of each retina cross and merge with uncrossed axons from the temporal retina of the contralateral eye so that each optic tract carries information exclusively from the contralateral visual field.</p>
                <p>Lesions at different locations along the visual pathway produce characteristic visual deficits. For example, section of one optic nerve produces complete ipsilateral anopia. A section through the optic chiasm produces heteronymous hemianopia, with loss of vision from the temporal half of each retina. Section of one optic tract produces homonymous hemianopia, with loss of vision from the temporal half of one retina and the nasal half of the other. In the visual cortex, visual images are reconstructed in a series of steps that go through different areas of the primary visual cortex and into other regions in the parietal lobe. Processing depends on highly ordered representation of different components of visual information in specific, sometimes overlapping neuronal populations (eg, ocular dominance layers, orientation-specific columns, color-specific blobs).</p>
                <p>Highest-acuity vision occurs when light strikes photoreceptors in the fovea, a specialized area of the retina in line with the visual axis through the center of the lens. The oculomotor system is designed both for rapid visual exploratory movements and to keep a selected image focused on the fovea. Eye movements in three axes are produced by coordinated activity in three pairs of extraocular muscles: the medial and lateral rectus muscles, which rotate the eye in the horizontal plane; the superior and inferior rectus muscles; and the superior and inferior oblique muscles, which cause vertical and torsional movements. Eye movements are composed of saccades (extremely rapid ballistic movements) that have an exploratory function and slower smooth pursuit movements that keep a target on the fovea and are subject to continuous modification. These movements are programmed and controlled by groups of interneurons in the brainstem (saccades) and cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and pons (smooth pursuit movements). Eye movements are coordinated with head movements and vestibular input and are influenced by visual attention and experience.</p>
                <p>Intrinsic muscles of the eye are innervated by the autonomic nervous system. Parasympathetic fibers excite ciliary muscles that control the shape of the lens and mediate the accommodation reflex. Contraction of ciliary muscle relieves tension on the lens, which becomes more spherical and brings near objects into focus. Parasympathetic fibers also innervate pupillary constrictor muscles, which mediate the pupillary reflex to bright light. Pupillary dilator muscles, which oppose constriction, are tonically excited by sympathetic fibers. During states of increased sympathetic activity (eg, certain emotions, fight or flight situations), the pupils dilate noticeably.</p>

                <p>Vertigo is a common complaint in the primary care setting. Vertigo can have numerous etiologies, including benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (most common), Ménière disease, toxic damage to labyrinth (medications), tumors (acoustic neuroma), migraine headaches, viral labyrinthitis, vertebrobasilar vascular disease (especially with cerebrovascular disease), head trauma, and multiple sclerosis. Treatment depends on the underlying etiology. Ménière disease is a syndrome of recurrent attacks of vertigo and tinnitus associated with hearing loss. The underlying pathophysiology is a disorder of fluid balance within the endolymphatic system, leading to degeneration of vestibular and cochlear hair cells.</p>

                <h3>Discussion</h3>
                <p>Sensory transduction in the vestibular system occurs in hair cells. Each hair cell has a hair bundle on the apical end that consists of a large kinocilium and 50 to 100 shorter stereocilia. Vestibular hair cells are located in the otolithic organs, the saccule and utricle, which detect gravitational forces during steady head positions. These hair cells project their hair bundles into a gelatinous cap that is encrusted with dense calcium carbonate otoliths. Gravity pulls the otoliths against the gelatinous cap, deflecting the stereocilia. Hair cells in the saccule and utricle are organized so that their polarities cover all directions, allowing these organs to detect changes in linear acceleration in any direction. Hair cells also are located in the three semicircular canals (anterior, posterior, and lateral), which transduce angular acceleration of the head in three dimensions. These organs lack otoliths; bending of stereocilia is produced by inertial forces of the endolymph when the head is rotated.</p>
                <p>In all vestibular organs, bending of the stereocilia toward the kinocilium depolarizes the hair cell, leading to release of the transmitter glutamate from the basal end, whereas deflection away from the kinocilium hyperpolarizes the cell, reducing background release of glutamate. The changes in potential produced by bending involve an unusual mechanism. The tips are bathed in endolymph, which has a remarkably high K+ concentration (150 mM) that exceeds the intracellular K+ concentration (140 mM). Bending toward the kinocilium increases tension on the extracellular filaments (“tip links”) that connect the tips of the stereocilia. This opens cation channels in the tips, and the resulting influx of K+ (driven by both the modest concentration gradient and the negative membrane potential) causes depolarization. At rest, a few of the cation channels remain open. When the stereocilia bend away from the kinocilium, these channels are closed, reducing tonic K+ influx and hyperpolarizing the cell.</p>
                <p>Release of glutamate from basal ends of hair cells excites peripheral terminals of primary sensory neurons that have their cell bodies in the ipsilateral vestibular ganglion, and the resulting action potentials travel along axons in the vestibular nerve to the vestibular nuclei in the medulla. Postsynaptic neurons in the vestibular nuclei then project to the spinal cord (helping to control posture), to motor nuclei that control eye movement (mediating vestibulo-ocular reflexes), and to the reticular formation (which can produce vertigo and the gag reflex).</p>
                <p>Hearing also begins with sensory transduction in hair cells, which in this case are located within the scala media of the cochlea, in the organ of Corti. The inner hair cells, which are less numerous but more richly innervated than the outer hair cells, are primarily responsible for sensing auditory information. The primary function of the outer hair cells is to lengthen when depolarized, which increases the distance between the basilar and tectorial membranes, allowing the basilar membrane to bend more and thus produce cochlear amplification of subsequent sound waves. Amplification of the effects of sound waves is also a consequence of the tips of the stereocilia of inner and outer hair cells being embedded in the tectorial membrane. This results in shearing forces being transmitted to the stereocilia during displacements of the basilar membrane by sound waves. Auditory hair cells in adults lack kinocilia, but other properties are the same as in vestibular hair cells. The endolymph has the same high concentration of K+, and bending of the stereocilia toward the longest stereocilium opens cation channels, permitting an influx of K+ to depolarize the cell, whereas bending in the opposite direction closes the channels, hyperpolarizing the cell.</p>
                <p>Pitch perception is determined primarily, although not exclusively, by the location in the organ of Corti that is maximally stimulated. Each tone produces a traveling wave in the cochlea; high pitches produce waves that peak near the base of the cochlea, and low pitches produce waves that peak near the apex. This results in a tonotopic organization of the hair cells, and this positional relationship is maintained throughout the auditory pathway. The inner hair cells release glutamate at synapses between their basal ends and the terminals of primary afferent neurons that have their cell bodies in the spiral ganglion in the cochlea. The central axons travel in the auditory nerve to make synapses on neurons in the cochlear nuclei, which project successively to the inferior olivary nuclei, the inferior colliculus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and then the primary auditory cortex. At each level, pitch is encoded by tonotopic organization and perhaps some coding by action potential frequency (“phase-lock” code), whereas loudness depends on the total number of active neurons and their firing rates. Sound localization depends on processing in the auditory cortex that analyzes differences in both the phase and the loudness of sound waves on the two sides of the head. In addition, directional differences in sound quality resulting from the shape and orientation of the pinna are detected.</p>

                    <li><strong>B.</strong> Otoliths are located in the otolithic organs, the saccule and utricle, not in the three semicircular canals. They are pulled by gravity against the gelatinous cap containing stereocilia, which can bend either toward or away from the kinocilium. This bending preferentially transduces linear acceleration rather than angular acceleration (which is transduced by hair cells in the semicircular canals).</li>
                    <li><strong>E.</strong> Opening of K+ channels in the stereocilia depolarizes the hair cells because the [K+]o in the endolymph surrounding the hair cell exceeds the [K+]i in the stereocilia.</li>
                    <li><strong>C.</strong> A high-pitched sound maximally excites hair cells near the apex of the cochlea, and those cells provide tonotopically organized input to central components of the auditory system. Hair cells in the organ of Corti in adults lack kinocilia, and they all use glutamate as their primary neurotransmitter. Although lower pitches may be encoded partially by action potential frequency, higher pitches have frequencies that are too high to allow this type of phase-lock code and thus rely solely on tonotopic coding.</li>

                    <li>Modest depolarization of a hair cell under basal conditions is maintained by a continuous influx of K+ through a fraction of the cation channels in stereocilia. Bending toward the kinocilium (in vestibular organs) or the tallest stereocilium (in the organ of Corti) opens additional channels, producing further depolarization, whereas bending in the opposite direction closes the channels, hyperpolarizing the hair cell.</li>
                    <li>Depolarization of hair cells increases vesicular release of glutamate, which depolarizes peripheral terminals of primary afferent neurons, initiating action potentials that travel along the vestibular or cochlear nerve into the brainstem.</li>

                <p>Disorders of olfaction are caused by conditions that may interfere with the olfactory epithelium, the receptors in the epithelium, or central neural pathways. Conditions that may interfere with the olfactory epithelium (transport loss) include allergic, viral, and bacterial rhinitis; nasal polyps or tumors; nasal septal deviation; and nasal surgery. Disorders of the receptors can be produced by medications, infections, tumors, toxic chemical exposures, and a history of radiation exposure. The list of central olfactory disorders is more extensive and includes conditions caused by alcoholism, Alzheimer disease, medications, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Kallmann syndrome, malnutrition, trauma, Parkinson disease, vitamin deficiencies, and Huntington chorea. This patient presents with Kallmann syndrome. Kallmann syndrome (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) is a disorder of both olfactory axonal and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuronal migration from the olfactory placode in the nose. This is why the patient is sexually infantile and has anosmia. The single gene mutation is on the X chromosome and is responsible for functions necessary for neuronal migration.</p>

                <h3>Discussion</h3>
                <p>Olfactory receptor cells are primary afferent neurons located in olfactory epithelium within the upper levels of the nasal cavities. They are unusual neurons because they are replaced continually throughout life, turning over every 4 to 8 weeks. In addition to the olfactory receptor neurons, the olfactory epithelium contains basal cells (stem cells to replace the receptor neurons) and glial-like support cells. Each olfactory receptor neuron projects a thick dendrite tipped with cilia that end in the mucus layer. The mucus contains odorant-binding proteins that concentrate odorants, as well as enzymes and antibodies. The antibodies provide important protection because olfactory receptor neurons present a direct path into the brain that could be used by viruses and bacteria present in aspirated air.</p>
                <p>Each olfactory receptor neuron produces only one of a large family of about 1000 odorant receptor proteins that are localized to the cilia and display a high specificity to particular odorant structures. Different odors stimulate different combinations of olfactory receptor neurons, and the average human can recognize about 10,000 separate odors (with intensive training that number may go up to about 300,000). Eighty percent of recognizable odors are unpleasant, representing potentially toxic or dangerous substances.</p>
                <p>Binding of an odorant to an odorant receptor causes excitation by the same sequence of mechanisms in all olfactory receptor neurons. The odorant receptors are members of the enormous superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors, and binding of a specific odorant to a receptor activates the G protein Golf, which in turn activates adenylyl cyclase. The resulting cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) opens cAMP-gated cation channels, permitting the influx of Na+ and Ca2+ (and the efflux of K+) and depolarizing the cell. The Ca2+ (and additional Ca2+ that can enter through depolarization-activated Ca2+ channels) then activates Ca2+-activated Cl− channels. Because olfactory receptor neurons have unusually high intracellular Cl− concentrations, opening these channels causes an efflux of Cl− and further depolarization, initiating action potentials. The action potentials are conducted relatively slowly along very thin unmyelinated olfactory receptor neuron axons a short distance into the overlying olfactory bulb by the olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I). Synapses from a very large number of olfactory receptor neuron axons are made onto a much smaller number of relay neurons (mitral cells and tufted cells) and inhibitory interneurons (periglomerular cells) within glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Information about different odorants is mapped on different glomeruli. The relay cells project directly to the olfactory cortex, which then projects through the thalamus to the orbitofrontal cortex, where odor perception and discrimination occur, and to the amygdala and hypothalamus, where emotional effects are produced.</p>
                <p>The olfactory epithelium is also innervated by the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), which contains axons of nociceptive chemoreceptors that have free nerve endings that detect noxious chemicals in the air, such as ammonia and chlorine (as well as components of peppermint and menthol). Activation of these epithelial nociceptors elicits defensive reflexes such as sneezing, lacrimation, and respiratory inhibition. Humans also have a small region of olfactory mucous membrane in the anterior nasal septum that may be homologous to the vomeronasal organ in other mammals. Receptors in this organ transduce olfactory stimuli by mechanisms different from those utilized by other olfactory receptor neurons and project by different pathways to the amygdala and hippocampus. In rodents, and possibly in humans, this accessory olfactory system detects pheromones that can influence sexual function.</p>
                <p>Taste receptor cells are modified epithelial cells that are clustered in taste buds on the tongue and, to a lesser extent, the palate, pharynx, epiglottis, and part of the upper esophagus. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 receptor cells as well as basal cells for the generation of new receptor cells (which live only about 10 days). Humans distinguish five tastes: salt, sour, sweet, bitter, and umami, although human perception of taste usually involves contributions from olfaction and even texture and temperature. Unlike the olfactory and visual systems, which each utilize a single basic transduction mechanism, transduction in taste receptor cells involves diverse mechanisms. In salt taste receptors, transduction occurs when a rise in Na+ concentration in the saliva results in sufficient influx of Na+ through voltage-insensitive epithelial Na+ channels (ENaCs), which are always open, to depolarize the cell. As in most taste cells, this leads to the opening of depolarization-activated Ca2+ channels followed by Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of transmitter onto dendrites of primary afferent neurons. Sour taste transduction involves a similar mechanism, with H+ ions permeating ENaCs to depolarize the cell. In addition, H+ ions can bind to and block K+ channels, which also depolarize the cell. Sweet taste transduction occurs when sugars bind to specific G protein-coupled surface receptors that stimulate the synthesis of cAMP, ultimately closing K+ channels.</p>
                <p>Other G protein-coupled receptors bound by sugars stimulate the 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) pathway, which releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores, directly enhancing Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of transmitter. Bitter taste transduction involves binding of bitter compounds to receptors linked to a G protein, gustducin, which stimulates phosphodiesterase and decreases cAMP and cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP) levels. In these cells cAMP and cGMP lead to hyperpolarization, and so their degradation produces depolarization. In addition, other G protein-coupled receptors stimulate the IP3 pathway in bitter taste receptors, causing release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and enhanced transmitter release, as in some of the sweet taste receptors. Finally, as in sour taste receptors, some bitter compounds can block K+ channels directly, depolarizing the cell. Umami taste receptors are stimulated by certain amino acids, including L-glutamate, which binds to a metabotropic glutamate receptor that activates phosphodiesterase to decrease cAMP and cGMP levels, as in some bitter taste receptor cells.</p>
                <p>Primary afferent neurons activated by transmitter released from taste receptor cells project to the gustatory division of the solitary nucleus in the medulla through the facial (cranial nerve VII), glossopharyngeal (cranial nerve IX), and vagus (cranial nerve X) nerves. Information then is relayed through the thalamus to the primary gustatory cortex in the insular and orbitofronal regions. Relatively little is known about central processing of taste.</p>

                    <li><strong>C.</strong> Olfactory receptor cells are true primary afferent neurons that conduct action potentials along their axons into the central nervous system (CNS), where they synapse onto second-order neurons in glomeruli within the olfactory bulb. The other receptor cells listed are epithelially derived cells that lack axons. Sensory information from these cells is conveyed by peripheral synapses to axonal terminals of primary afferent neurons that then project (often over long distances) into the CNS.</li>
                    <li><strong>E.</strong> Each olfactory receptor neuron expresses only one of 10,000 possible receptor proteins. Odorant binding to its receptor acts through the G protein Golf in peripheral receptor terminals, leading to the synthesis of cAMP, which opens cAMP-gated cation channels that permit diffusion of Na+, Ca2+, and K+, producing the net effect of depolarization and initiation of action potentials that travel to central synaptic terminals.</li>

                <p>Transections of the central nervous system (CNS) above and within the spinal cord have different effects on motor reflexes. When a transection takes place along the spinal cord, there is loss of voluntary movements and conscious sensation below the level of the transection. The muscles that are innervated below the lesion initially become flaccid and lose reflex responses during spinal shock. Depending on the location of the lesion, various other physical signs may be present, including urinary and/or fecal incontinence, decreased heart rate and pressure, and respiratory failure. Spasticity and hyperreflexia develop later. Lesions of motor pathways above the spinal cord result in muscle rigidity and hyperreflexia without a period of flaccid paralysis. Decerebrate and decorticate posturing may develop with transections above the spinal cord.</p>

                <p>Alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord have their cell bodies in the ventral horn and send their axons out the ventral roots to innervate axial, flexor, or extensor muscles in the trunk, limbs, and digits. Motor neurons that innervate muscles in the head and neck have their cell bodies in motor nuclei in the brainstem and send their axons out the cranial nerves. All the muscle fibers innervated by a single motor neuron constitute a motor unit. Motor units vary in size from two or three fibers in the fingers, where fine control is important, to more than a thousand fibers in antigravity muscles of the leg. Each action potential in an alpha motor neuron evokes a single twitch in each fiber in the motor unit. Large sustained contractions require the temporal summation of trains of high-frequency twitches. Small motor units are recruited more readily than are large motor units because the size of the motor neuron soma is proportional to the size of the motor unit, and smaller somata are more sensitive to their synaptic inputs than are larger somata (size principle). Motor neurons that innervate fast-twitch fibers fire at higher frequencies than do motor neurons that innervate slow-twitch fibers.</p>
                <p>Muscle length and tension are monitored by proprioceptive sensory (afferent) neurons, whose cell bodies are in dorsal root ganglia and which have peripheral terminals in specialized sensory structures within the muscle. Muscle length properties are sensed by terminals that coil around thin intrafusal fibers in muscle spindles. These muscle fibers, which regulate sensory sensitivity, lie in parallel with the thicker extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers that do the effective contractile work. Group Ia afferents in the spindle detect both the absolute muscle length and the rate of change in length of the intrafusal fiber. Group II afferents monitor static length of the intrafusal fiber. Muscle tension properties are detected in the Golgi tendon organs, which lie in series with the muscle fibers and their tendons. Group Ib afferents terminate in these organs and monitor the force exerted by extrafusal muscle contraction or passive stretch. By exciting interneurons that inhibit the same or homonymous (synergistic) alpha motor neurons, the Ib afferents trigger the reverse (or inverse) myotatic reflex, which protects the muscle from excessive contraction. In contrast, the stretch (also known as the deep tendon or myotatic) reflex is initiated when Ia afferents detect stretch of the intrafusal fibers. These afferents make monosynaptic excitatory synaptic connections to alpha motor neurons, innervating the same or homonymous muscle. The Ia afferent pathway drives a homeostatic system in which imposed stretch automatically elicits a compensatory contraction—an arrangement that contributes to balance, posture, and muscle tone. The sensitivity of this system is maintained during active contraction of surrounding extrafusal fibers by the coactivation of a second type of motor neuron along with the alpha motor neurons. These gamma motor neurons excite the intrafusal muscles and prevent them from becoming flaccid when the parallel extrafusal muscles contract. The activity of the gamma motor neurons, and hence the sensitivity of the stretch reflex, can be adjusted by several descending pathways from the brain.</p>
                <p>Numerous motor patterns and reflexes are mediated by spinal circuits without the need for input from higher centers. In addition to the stretch and reverse myotatic reflexes, an important reflex is the withdrawal (flexor) reflex of a limb triggered by the activation of somatic nociceptor terminals in the limb. These sensory neurons activate excitatory interneurons which in turn activate flexor motor neurons that innervate the ipsilateral limb. In addition, the nociceptors activate inhibitory interneurons that produce reciprocal inhibition of the extensor motor neurons which innervate the same limb. Interneurons also activate a second reflex, the crossed-extensor reflex, which extends the contralateral leg to provide balance and support during leg flexion. During defensive arm flexion, the crossed-extensor reflex causes a protective extension of the contralateral arm. Another reflex is the scratch reflex, which involves repetitive contraction and relaxation of muscles in the arm and hand that are generated by interneuronal circuits within the spinal cord. Groups of interneurons within the spinal cord also generate the complex patterns of motor output responsible for locomotion.</p>
                <p>The circuits underlying these reflexes and motor patterns are used as building blocks for more complex behaviors that are controlled hierarchically by higher brain structures. Descending input to spinal motor circuits comes by several pathways. One is the lateral corticospinal tract (pyramidal tract), which carries commands for conscious, voluntary movements from upper motor neurons in the primary motor cortex to lower motor neurons in the spinal cord that control distal muscles. Similarly, lower motor neurons that control proximal muscles receive commands through the ventral corticospinal tract. Upper motor neurons that control muscles in the face and head send their axons into another pyramidal tract, the corticobulbar tract, to synapse with lower motor neurons in brainstem motor nuclei. A second major pathway to the spinal cord is the ventromedial pathway, which consists of four tracts from brainstem regions that are involved in posture and locomotion: the vestibulospinal, tectospinal, pontine reticulospinal, and medullary reticulospinal tracts. Direct and indirect input to spinal motor neurons also comes from the cerebellum and basal ganglia.</p>
                <p>Although upper motor neurons excite lower motor neurons, as well as interneurons, much of the descending input to spinal motor neurons is inhibitory. Damage to descending pathways at any level above a specific spinal segment (lumped together as upper motor neuron lesions) removes these excitatory and inhibitory influences and thus produces profound effects on reflexes mediated by that segment. These effects include some weakness (because of decreased excitation of alpha motor neurons and some interneurons), increased muscle tone (rigidity), and prominent spasticity, which is characterized by hyperactive stretch reflexes and increased resistance to rapid muscle stretch. Mechanisms of spasticity are unclear but appear to involve disinhibition of spinal neurons, including interneurons and gamma motor neurons. Transection of the spinal cord causes a period of spinal shock for a few weeks in which all spinal reflexes below the transection are reduced severely or abolished (flaccid paralysis). This probably results from sudden interruption of descending facilitatory influences. Reflexes then gradually recover and eventually become exaggerated, perhaps because of disinhibition, denervation supersensitivity of motor neurons and interneurons, and/or sprouting of additional afferent terminals. Spinal transection also interrupts autonomic pathways, and this can result in urinary and/or fecal incontinence, increased or decreased heart rate and blood pressure, and respiratory failure. Lesions of peripheral nerves that transect motor neuron axons cause flaccid paralysis and a total loss of voluntary and reflex responses from the denervated muscles, spontaneous twitch-like fasciculations, and muscle atrophy. If the entire nerve is not transected, peripheral axons sometimes can regenerate so that many months after nerve injury the reflexes recover partially or (rarely) completely.</p>

                <h3>Discussion</h3>
                <p>The basal ganglia, located near the thalamus in the diencephalon, are composed of five pairs of nuclei: the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra. The basal ganglia receive synaptic input from motor cortex (as well as from sensory association and prefrontal cortex) and send their output to the thalamus, which then feeds back to the cortex. Although the functions of the basal ganglia are not well understood, strong evidence indicates that through these connections from and back to motor cortical areas, the basal ganglia provide a motor loop that contributes to the planning and programming of voluntary movements. In addition, the basal ganglia appear to be important for some cognitive processes, such as those involving the organization of behavioral responses and verbal problem solving.</p>
                <p>The motor loop comprises two parallel pathways that travel from the cortex through the basal ganglia and then to the thalamus and back to the cortex. Each branch has an opposite effect on thalamic targets. The direct pathway goes through the caudate and putamen (which together form the neostriatum) to the internal segment of the globus pallidus and the pars reticulata segment of the substantia nigra and then to the ventral anterior and centromedian nuclei of the thalamus. The indirect pathway goes through the external segment of the globus pallidus, then to the subthalamus, and then (like the direct pathway) to the internal segment of the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Each pathway is activated by excitatory synapses (releasing glutamate) from cortical regions. Both pathways inhibit neurons in the thalamus via fibers from the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, which release γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In the direct pathway, neurons in the neostriatum directly inhibit (via GABA release) the neurons in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. In the indirect pathway, neurons in the neostriatum inhibit neurons in the external segment of the globus pallidus, which inhibit neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, which then excite neurons in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Because the indirect pathway has two inhibitory synapses in series and the direct pathway has only one inhibitory synapse (onto the globus pallidus and substantia nigra), activation of the indirect pathway will increase the activity of the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, whereas activation of the direct pathway will decrease activity in the same nuclei.</p>
                <p>The output neurons for both pathways in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra are usually active at high frequency and tonically inhibit target nuclei in the thalamus. When the direct pathway is activated transiently, the tonically active output neurons are inhibited transiently, and this disinhibition increases activity in the thalamus and thereby in the cortex (the motor loop shows positive feedback). When the indirect pathway is activated transiently, the output neurons are excited, and activity in the thalamus and cortex is inhibited (negative feedback). In the basal ganglia, most of the synapses are inhibitory (releasing GABA), and excitation is produced by inhibiting an inhibitory pathway (disinhibition).</p>
                <p>Both the direct and indirect pathways are modulated by the nigrostriatal pathway by neurons in the pars compacta segment of the substantia nigra that release dopamine onto neurons in the neostriatum. Neurons in the neostriatum that mediate the direct pathway have D1 dopamine receptors that produce excitation. In contrast, neurons in the neostriatum that mediate the indirect pathway have D2 dopamine receptors that produce inhibition. Thus, dopamine release from pars compacta neurons excites the direct pathway, which inhibits the output neurons, thereby increasing thalamic activity and ultimately facilitating movements initiated in the cortex. Synergistically, dopamine inhibits the indirect pathway, further increasing the inhibition of the output neurons. Many of the effects of Parkinson disease can be explained by a marked reduction in dopamine release (caused by degeneration and death of neurons in the substantia nigra) that results in less disinhibition of thalamic activity and thus decreased facilitation of movements initiated in the cortex. The substantia nigra is also the source of dopaminergic input to the rest of the brain with the exception of the pituitary gland, which receives dopaminergic fibers from the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. The mesolimbic and mesocortical tracts arising from the substantia nigra contribute to affect, emotion, and motivation and also are involved in schizophrenia.</p>
                <p>Basal ganglia disorders also occur after lesions to these nuclei, most commonly caused by small strokes. Lesions of the subthalamic nucleus often result in involuntary, sometimes violent movements of the contralateral limbs; this is termed hemiballism because of the resemblance to throwing movements. Hemiballism appears to result from disinhibition of the thalamus caused by reduction of activity in the output nuclei of the basal ganglia (especially the internal pallidal segment) that sometimes is caused by a decrease in excitation from the subthalamic nucleus. Huntington disease, a heritable hyperkinetic disorder, is caused by widespread loss of neurons that begins in the striatum with loss of the neurons that give rise to the indirect pathway. This results in inhibition of subthalamic nucleus neurons and choreiform movements and hemiballism-like movements in early stages of the disease. After the disease progresses, rigidity and akinesia develop (as in Parkinson disease) because the neurons that project directly to the internal pallidal segment are lost.</p>

                    <li><strong>C.</strong> The majority of synapses from neurons in the basal ganglia are inhibitory and release GABA. The other major inhibitory neurotransmitter, glycine, is not important in the basal ganglia and is released primarily from inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord. Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter that is released by neurons in the substantia nigra, but these neurons account for only a small fraction of the total number of neurons in the basal ganglia. In addition, other neurotransmitters (eg, acetylcholine, NO, various neuropeptides) are released from some neurons in the basal ganglia, but the largest number of synapses are GABAergic.</li>
                    <li><strong>C.</strong> The basal ganglia and thalamus form a motor loop with the cerebral cortex. Input to the basal ganglia comes from prefrontal and sensory association areas of the cerebral cortex and leaves the basal ganglia via the internal segment of the globus pallidus. The immediate target of these neurons is the thalamus (ventral anterior, ventral lateral, and centromedian nuclei). These thalamic nuclei then project to motor areas in the cerebral cortex.</li>
                    <li><strong>E.</strong> Under normal conditions, dopamine released by neurons in the substantia nigra affects both the direct and indirect pathways in the motor loop to the cerebral cortex, exciting the direct, stimulatory pathway to the thalamus and inhibiting the indirect, inhibitory pathway to the thalamus. Thus, if the dopamine-containing neurons degenerate (as occurs in Parkinson disease), the excitatory actions on the thalamus are inhibited and there is less disinhibition of the inhibitory actions, with the consequence that excitation from the thalamus to motor areas in the cortex is decreased and it becomes more difficult to initiate movements. The other effects listed (answers A–D) would not be produced by selective loss of dopaminergic neurons, but instead by lesions of the subthalamic nucleus or early stages of striatal neuron loss.</li>

                    <li>The four principal nuclei of the basal ganglia are the striatum, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus.</li>
                    <li>The motor loop comprises two parallel pathways that travel from the cortex through the basal ganglia and then to the thalamus and back to the cortex. In the direct pathway, excitatory input to the basal ganglia excites thalamic neurons by inhibiting the inhibitory output neurons in the internal segment of the globus pallidus. In the indirect pathway, excitatory input to the basal ganglia further inhibits thalamic neurons by disinhibiting the inhibitory output neurons in the internal segment of the globus pallidus.</li>
                    <li>GABA is the most prominent inhibitory neurotransmitter in most of the brain, although glycine is an important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord and brainstem.</li>
                    <li>Dopamine release from pars compacta neurons in the substantia nigra excites the direct pathway (by D1 receptors), which inhibits the inhibitor output neurons, thereby increasing thalamic activity and ultimately facilitating movements initiated in the cortex, whereas dopamine simultaneously inhibits the indirect pathway (by D2 receptors), further increasing the inhibition of the inhibitory output neurons.</li>
                    <li>Loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson disease reduces the activation of the direct pathway as well as the inhibition of the indirect pathway, allowing greater inhibition of thalamic neurons and greater suppression of movements initiated in the cortex </li>
