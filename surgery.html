                <p>A 76-year-old man with an 8-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), gout, and mild chronic renal insufficiency is evaluated for open AAA repair. His history includes coronary angioplasty and stent placement 8 months ago, and he is active, walking 1 mile daily. Medications include metoprolol, allopurinol, aspirin, and clopidogrel.</p>

                <h4 class="font-semibold">Considerations</h4>
                <p>The timing of the patient’s development of respiratory insufficiency is within the expected timeframe of pulmonary embolism (PE) and ALI. The patient’s pulmonary examination reveals diminished breath sounds and scattered rhonchi, which are nonspecific findings that are compatible with ALI, atelectasis, and PE. His CXR findings reveal bilateral nonsegmental infiltrates, and the ABG reveals moderate hypoxemia. The CXR findings are not compatible with the PE, as patients with PE generally have relatively normal CXRs or may have segmental infiltrate associated with segmental pulmonary infarction. By strict definition, ALI diagnosis requires the respiratory insufficiency to be acute in onset (such as in this patient), associated with a PaO2/FiO2 < 300, nonsegmental infiltrates on CXR, and with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) that is less than 18 mm Hg. Even though the initial presentation in this patient’s case has several key features associated with ALI or ARDS, it is important to consider and rule out other possible causes, including aspiration pneumonitis, atypical pneumonia, atelectasis, and PE. In a setting of recent trauma, it is also important to consider the possibility of missed injuries within the abdomen as the cause of his current respiratory insufficiency. With these considerations in mind, our first priority for this patient is to address his respiratory insufficiency. Given the significant tachypnea and tachycardia that this patient is demonstrating, it is very reasonable to consider intubation and mechanical ventilation. The main reason for intubation is to help stabilize his respiratory status while we sort out the potential causes of his current problem.</p>

                <h4 class="font-semibold">Definitions</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                    <li><strong>Aspiration:</strong> Spillage of gastric contents into the bronchial tree causing direct injury to the airways, which can progress to a chemical burn or pneumonitis (especially if the pH is < 3) and predisposes to bacterial pneumonia. When the aspirated gastric contents contain particulate matter, bronchoscopy may be helpful to help in clearing the airway. Roughly half of the patients with aspiration events will develop pneumonia; however, antibiotics treatment is not indicated unless the pneumonia develops.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pneumonia:</strong> Pulmonary infection caused by impairment of the lung’s defense mechanisms. Incisional pain frequently affects the patient’s ability to clear airway mucus, leading to small airway obstruction and ineffective bacteria clearance. Most commonly, nosocomial organisms colonize the patients during the hospitalization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Atelectasis:</strong> The collapse of alveolar units occurs in patients undergoing general anesthesia, which causes a reduction in functional residual capacity that is further reduced because of incisional pain. The subsegmental atelectasis may progress to obstruction and inflammation, leading to larger airway obstruction and segmental collapse. Most patients only have a low-grade fever and mild respiratory insufficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema:</strong> Myocardial dysfunction most frequently resulting from ischemia can produce left ventricular dysfunction, fluid overload, and pulmonary interstitial edema. The increase in the amount of interstitial water can cause compression of the bronchovascular structures and additional V/Q mismatches and worsening hypoxia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pulmonary Embolism:</strong> A major source of morbidity and mortality in surgical patients. The prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of PE are continuous concerns for the surgeon. Bed rest, cancer, and trauma increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE. PE can be clinically silent or symptomatic. In high-risk surgical patients, the risk of developing a clinically significant PE is 2% to 3%, and the risk of developing a fatal PE is close to 1%. The clinical hallmarks include acute-onset of hypoxia associated with anxiety leading to tachypnea and hypocarbia, which are often without significant CXR abnormalities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pulmonary Contusion:</strong> Blunt trauma to the chest is a common cause of pulmonary dysfunction resulting from direct parenchymal injury and impaired chest wall function. Injury to the chest wall and ribs can lead to impaired breathing mechanics that range from splinting secondary to pain to disrupted mechanics secondary to a flail chest. The morbidity from lung contusion is attributed to direct parenchymal injury and bronchoalveolar hemorrhage, causing ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatches and hypoxemia. This condition is worsened by chest wall injury pain, leading to atelectasis in the uninvolved lung.</li>
                    <li><strong>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS):</strong> This is a severe form of ALI where the PaO2/FiO2 is less than 200. The patients generally have decreased oxygen exchange in addition to decreased pulmonary compliance. Pathologically, there is injury to the pulmonary endothelial cells with intense inflammatory responses. In general, the injury is inhomogeneous. Associated with the inflammatory changes are interstitial and alveolar edema, loss of type II pneumocytes, surfactant depletion, intra-alveolar hemorrhage, hyaline membrane deposition, and eventual fibrosis. These changes manifest clinically as severe hypoxia, decreased pulmonary compliance, and increase in dead space ventilation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ventilator Bundle:</strong> Consists of a combination of patient care strategies that have been demonstrated to reduce ventilation days, ICU length of stay, and mortality in mechanically ventilated patients. These interventions include: (1) elevation of head of bed; (2) stress ulcer prophylaxis; (3) DVT prophylaxis; (4) daily sedation interruption; (5) daily assessment of readiness for weaning and removal from ventilatory support.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI):</strong> Positive-pressure-ventilation-associated mechanical ventilators are capable of producing a variety of injuries to the lungs, and these injuries can occur secondary to over-inflation, overdistension, and repetitive opening and closing of the alveoli. High-oxygen delivery to the lungs can cause oxygen free radical formation and hyperoxic injuries. Ventilation strategies to reduce VILI include: (1) low tidal volume ventilation (5-7 mL/kg tidal volume); (2) reduction of FiO2 to < 60% within 48 to 72 hours; (3) application of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to reduce atelectasis.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="font-semibold">Clinical Approach</h4>
                <h5 class="font-medium">Patient Assessment</h5>
                <p>The initial priority in the management of a patient with acute respiratory distress is to assess and stabilize the ABCs. Prioritizing the ABCs is important, because acute respiratory distress can be a manifestation of a primary pulmonary, cardiac, or a systemic inflammatory/infectious process. The assessment of each patient should be directed at the patient’s current status, as well as toward the anticipated condition of the patient. The inability to maintain PaO2 of 60 mm Hg or an oxygen saturation of 91% with a supplemental nonrebreathing O2 mask indicates significant alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient, suggesting that mechanical ventilation should be instituted. An example of a patient with high likelihood of developing future respiratory failure is a patient with ALI who may not require immediate intubation and mechanical ventilatory support because he/she is able to maintain a high level of ventilatory efforts; however, if the condition is believed to be not amendable to immediate correction, the patient will not be able sustain his/her current level of respiratory effort and may benefit from ventilatory support to prevent the onset of respiratory failure at a later time.</p>
                <p>In general, the ventilatory status of a patient is assessed based on respiratory rate, and respiratory efforts (use of accessory muscles), and subjective respiratory symptoms. Hypoventilation can be recognized by hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis on an arterial blood gas. Hypoxemia is detected often on the basis of patient’s subjective respiratory complaint, low O2 saturation by pulse oximetry, and a low PaO2 on the blood gas. It is important to keep in mind the diagnosis of hypoxemia or hypoventilation should be based on the clinical assessment and a combination of factors, and not be based on a single laboratory parameter or a pulse oximetry reading.</p>
                <h5 class="font-medium">Pathophysiology of Acute Lung Injury</h5>
                <p>Acute lung injury (ALI) encompasses a spectrum of lung disease from mild forms to severe lung injury or ARDS. The inciting event can be a direct or indirect pulmonary insult. The resultant cascade of events includes both cellular and humoral components that produce an inhomogeneous pattern of lung injury. The inflammatory response involves activated polymorphonucleocytes, which generate oxygen free radicals, cytokines, lipid mediators, and nitric oxide. The complement, kinin, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems are also involved. Endothelial damage ensues with an increase in microvasculature permeability, leading to the accumulation of extravascular lung water, and resulting in diminished lung volume and decreased lung compliance. As the process progresses, lung compliance is further reduced due to sloughing of type I pneumocytes and a decrease in surfactant production by type II pneumocytes. Later in the process, there is an increase in interstitial edema, alveolar collapse, and lung consolidation. During the prodromal phase of ALI, a patient may simply complain of difficulty in catching their breath, leading to tachypnea. Hypoxia will generally follow as ALI progresses. Hyperventilation is often a key finding in ALI patients, and this is contributed by an increase in V/Q mismatches in the lungs causing increase in dead-space ventilation (leading to the need to increase respiratory effort to eliminate the usual amount of CO2).</p>
                <h5 class="font-medium">Noninvasive Respiratory Support</h5>
                <p>Some patients with acute postoperative respiratory insufficiency can be supported with supplemental oxygen therapy or noninvasive respiratory support such as the BIPAP mask. The use of the BIPAP mask provides the patient with some PEEP as well as higher levels of oxygenation than conventional masks. It should be applied with caution in individuals with conditions that are not readily correctable (such as atelectasis or fluid overload). The use of noninvasive ventilatory support is associated with an increase in aspiration events and should not be used in patients who are unable to cooperate or protect their airways effectively.</p>
                <h5 class="font-medium">Mechanical Ventilation Modes</h5>
                <p><strong>Conventional Ventilation:</strong> Conventional ventilation or positive-pressure ventilation fills the lungs by supra-atmospheric pressure applied through an endotracheal tube in the airway. This creates a positive transpulmonary pressure that ensures inflation of the lungs. Exhalation is passive and occurs after the release of positive pressure in the ventilator circuit. The ventilator settings that are applied can be either volume controlled or pressure controlled.</p>
                <p><strong>High-Frequency Ventilation:</strong> High-frequency ventilation also uses an endotracheal tube to facilitate gas exchange; however, it delivers very small tidal volumes on the order of 1 mL/kg body weight at rates of 100 to 400 breaths/minute. This ventilatory mode has been shown to be beneficial for the support of infants with respiratory distress syndrome; however, the benefits of high-frequency ventilator support in adults are less clear.</p>
                <p><strong>Extracorporeal Life Support:</strong> Cardiopulmonary bypass of extracorporeal life support uses a heart-lung machine to take over the patient’s respiratory and/or cardiac functions. If the cardiac function is adequate, a venovenous bypass circuit can be used to remove CO2 and oxygenate the blood. As in the case of high-frequency ventilation, the greatest success has been achieved in neonates, and the application of these supportive modes in adults has not been well defined.</p>

If the pulmonary wedge pressure is elevated above 18 mm Hg, then cardiogenic pulmonary edema is the more likely diagnosis.</li>
                    <li>E. The patient’s worsening respiratory distress and clinical deterioration can be attributed to several possible processes, including pneumothorax, pulmonary contusion, and atelectasis. An acute change in the patient’s respiratory status requires a re-evaluation of the ABCs, which includes diminished bilateral breath sounds bilaterally with less audible breath sounds on the left. A chest x-ray would be very helpful at this point to determine if a pneumothorax is the cause of this problem. Intubation and mechanical ventilation is the right choice if the patient is in impending respiratory failure. ABG results are helpful for the revaluation of some patients with respiratory distress; however, the results in this patient would not help direct therapy. Diuretic therapy is not appropriate for a patient with respiratory distress and hyperdynamic status and no clear evidence of volume overload.</li>
                    <li>B. This patient’s story and findings are highly suggestive of ALI secondary to forced inspiration against a closed or narrowed airway, resulting in “negative pressure pulmonary edema”; negative pressure pulmonary edema is an unusual variant of ALI and is often self-limiting with supportive care that includes mechanical ventilation and judicious fluid management.</li>
                    <li>B. This man develops fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea 9 days after exploratory laparotomy for GSW to the abdomen with multiple intestinal injuries. With slow return of bowel functions and distension of the abdomen, we should be concerned about the possibility of intra-abdominal sepsis, possibly related to an abscess or an anastamotic breakdown. CT scan plus antibiotics are probably the best option at this time, and exploration plus antibiotics are a second best option.</li>

                <h4 class="font-semibold">Considerations</h4>
                <p>The initial assessment of this patient should begin with the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs), followed by a secondary survey. Simultaneously, intravenous lines should be placed, blood specimens should be collected, vital signs should be monitored, and supplemental oxygen should be continued and titrated to achieve oxygen saturations > 94% to 95%. Given his diminished left-sided breath sounds, chest wall tenderness, and chest wall crepitance, it is reasonable to perform a left tube thoracostomy (chest tube placement) for presumed left pneumothorax. In this patient’s case, if a chest radiograph can be obtained quickly, the left tube thoracostomy can be delayed until a confirmatory CXR is obtained. However, a chest x-ray should never be the reason to delay care in a patient with findings compatible with having a pneumothorax. Frequent re-assessment of the patient’s cardiopulmonary status is important to make sure that he maintains acceptable oxygenation and perfusion, and responds appropriately to the therapeutic interventions. If the patient’s respiratory status worsens after chest tube placement, then intubation and mechanical ventilation should be considered to help restore respiratory stability. After the ABCs are adequately addressed, the patient should undergo appropriate imaging to identify all potential injuries.</p>
                <p>The evaluation and treatment of this patient is to assess, identify, and address all the injuries that could be produced by the traumatic energy transfer to the patient as the result of the automobile crash.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Approach</h3>
                <h4 class="font-semibold">Definitions</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                    <li><strong>Occult Pneumothorax:</strong> This is a pneumothorax seen on CT scan but not visualized by CXR. This condition is identified in 2% to 10% of blunt trauma patients. A large observational study has reported that if a chest tube is not placed immediately, approximately 6% of the patients with this diagnosis go on to require chest tube placement during the observational period, and patients who require positive-pressure ventilation are more likely to require chest tube placement than those who are not on positive-pressure ventilation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tension Pneumothorax:</strong> A pneumothorax that has increased in size to the point of causing a decrease in venous return to the heart and the potential for hypotension and cardiac arrest. Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis, but X-ray may reveal a shift of the mediastinal structures to the opposite side of the chest, and with shifting of the mediastinal structures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pulmonary Contusion:</strong> Lung parenchymal injury that occurs most commonly after high-energy blunt trauma to the chest. In most patients, the pulmonary contusions are associated with rib fractures or flail chest involving the overlying chest wall. Areas of the lung with pulmonary contusions are susceptible to capillary leakage and secondary inflammatory injuries, which can be made worse by pulmonary edema; therefore, excessive fluid administration should be avoided during the management of these patients.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flail Chest:</strong> Injury to the chest wall that causes a segment of the chest wall to become disrupted from the remaining chest wall. In all cases, this is associated with rib fractures that occur in more than one location, leading to that chest wall segment to move independently from the rest of the chest during respiration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blunt Diaphragmatic Injury:</strong> Rupture of the diaphragm can occur with high-energy blunt trauma to the chest and/or abdomen. This type of injury is more common on the left side. Rib fractures are commonly associated injuries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA):</strong> CTA is a CT imaging technique obtained with the administration of intravenous contrast. This imaging sequence is designed to optimally assess arterial anatomy. The CTA is currently the “gold standard” for the detection of blunt thoracic aortic injuries. The advantage of modern CTA techniques is that three-dimensional reconstructions can be rendered to visualize even minor abnormalities.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="font-semibold">Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>Blunt chest injuries are identified in 30% to 50% of patients with multiple blunt trauma, with motor vehicle crashes, fall from height, and automobile versus pedestrian crashes being some of the most common injury mechanisms. The approach to patients with multiple blunt traumas prioritizes the diagnosis and management of injuries in the sequence and time frame that are appropriate for the various injuries. A simple question to ask is: “What will kill the patient first?” and then address those issues first. Tension pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, blunt cardiac injury, and thoracic aortic disruption are the leading causes of early death associated with blunt chest injuries.</p>
                <p>Rib fractures are common injuries that can be identified clinically based on focal tenderness by palpation, by plain radiography, or by CT imaging. Rib fracture diagnosis is important not only because these injuries can be a source of morbidity, in that the pain and discomfort associated with the fractures can lead to decreased respiratory efforts, splinting, and decrease mobility causing atelectasis, hypoxia, and pulmonary infections. Another important concern is the potential for injuries to structures beneath the ribs. For example, the presence of left lower rib fractures should raise our clinical suspicion for injuries to the spleen. Rib fracture diagnosis should raise our suspicion for associated conditions including pulmonary contusion, pneumothorax, and hemothorax. The presence of two or more rib fractures in patients over the age 45 has been reported to be associated with morbidity and even mortality. Therefore, older individuals with rib fractures should be recognized as patients who are at risk of developing complications, and admission to the hospital for pain control, monitoring, and chest physiotherapy is generally indicated. Pain control for patients with rib fractures is of critical importance, and this can be accomplished either with placement of epidural catheter or by patient controlled analgesia (PCA).</p>

                <p>Sternal fracture in blunt trauma patients is not common. Patients with sternal fractures identified in the setting of multisystem injuries often have rib fractures, pneumothoraces, hemothoraces, and pulmonary contusion. Patients with isolated sternal fractures from blunt trauma do not have an increased risk of pulmonary injuries or cardiac injuries; therefore, many patients with isolated sternal fractures can be safely managed as outpatients.</p>
                <p>Pneumothorax in the setting of blunt trauma is most commonly produced by disruption of the visceral pleura with the majority of injuries created by rib penetration or from direct impact causing disruption of the lung parenchyma. Patients with small and relatively asymptomatic pneumothorax can be treated with supplemental oxygen and monitored with repeat chest x-rays. It is important to monitor the patients with pneumothorax who are managed without chest tube placement, because simple pneumothorax will occasionally progress into tension pneumothorax. A symptomatic patient or a patient with a large pneumothorax should be treated with the placement of chest tube (tube thoracostomy) to help re-expand the lung and facilitate closure of the air leak. Following chest tube placement, the patient should be monitored for air leak and drainage volume. Most patients with chest tube placement will have resolution of the pneumothorax and can have chest tube removal about 48 hours after resolution of the pneumothorax. If there is persistent large air leak and/or failure of lung re-expansion with the chest tube attached to suction, the possibility of a major tracheobronchial injury must be considered.</p>
                <p>Hemothorax describes the accumulation of blood in the pleural cavity. Bleeding into the pleural space can range from minor self-limiting events to massive life-threatening processes. Hemothorax symptoms are related to the amount of blood accumulation. Blunt trauma-related hemothorax is diagnosed by chest x-ray, which demonstrates opacification of the involved hemithorax. Each pleural space can accommodate up to 3000 mL of fluid. Because the pleural spaces are potential sites for significant blood losses, all blunt trauma patients with the potential of having multiple injuries should have CXRs performed to look for potential bleeding in the pleural spaces. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable with large hemothoraces and no other sources of blood loss should undergo thoracotomy for control of bleeding. Similarly, most practitioners believe that strong considerations for surgical treatment should also be given to patients with greater than 1500 mL of initial output with chest tube placement and patients with greater than 200 mL/h bloody output for 4 or more hours.</p>
                <p>Retained hemothorax is a problem that occurs in a small percentage of patients following chest tube placement for traumatic hemothorax. Some of the patients with retained hemothorax can go on to develop empyema and fibrothorax. Surgical evacuation is indicated for patients with large retained hemothoraces; whereas, most patients with less than 300 mL of retained hemothorax can be safely observed.</p>
                <p>Blunt cardiac injury (BCI) is the cause of death in 45% to 76% of the victims who die following blunt trauma. Patients with BCI often have multiple injuries, including traumatic brain injury, thoracic aortic injuries, lung injuries, chest wall injuries, and vertebral injuries. The spectrum of BCI encountered in clinical practices can range from self-limiting sinus tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and ventricular arrhythmias (rare), to the less common presentations of pump failure and cardiac rupture. The Eastern Association of Surgery for Trauma Guidelines published in 2012 recommended that an admission ECG be performed on all patients in whom blunt cardiac injuries are suspected (level 1 evidence), and that patients with new ECG abnormalities should undergo monitoring for cardiac rhythm or pump abnormalities for 24 hours (level 2 evidence). Most practitioners agree that if the initial ECG is normal and a serum troponin I is < 0.4 ng/mL, the patient with suspected BCI can be safely discharged from the emergency center (level 2b evidence).</p>
                <p>Traumatic rupture of the aorta (TRA) is the second leading cause of death from blunt trauma (traumatic brain injury is number 1). TRA should be suspected based on patients’ injury mechanisms, with high-energy MVC and motorcycle crashes (MCC), auto-versus-pedestrian crashes, and fall from heights being the most common. The abnormalities observed on CXR in these patients include a left apical cap, mediastinal widening, obscured aortic knob, widening of the paravertebral stripe, downward deviation of the left mainstem bronchus, rightward deviation of the NG tube, and opacification of the aorto-pulmonary window. It is important to note that “normal CXR” has been reported in 7% to 13% of the patients with TRA. In the past, patients with suspected TRA underwent aortography for confirmation of injuries; however, CT-angiography (CTA) is now the preferred method of diagnosis of TRA. TRAs can range in severity from minimal intimal tears (< 1 cm tear with minimal or no contrast extravasation), contained ruptures, to free-ruptures. Management choices for TRAs include conservative treatment, thoracic endovascular aortic repairs (TEVARs), and open repairs. Treatment selection is mainly determined by the patient’s clinical conditions, aortic injury type and severity, as well as patient co-morbidities and associated injuries. All patients with TRAs should be initially managed with controlled hypotension to maintain a systolic BP of 100 mm Hg until definitive repair or continued medical therapy is instituted. TEVARs are associated with lower rates of procedural-related complications; therefore in most centers, TEVARs have replaced open repairs as the preferred treatment approach.</p>

During monitoring in the emergency center, he is found to have a brief period (3 minutes) of supraventricular tachycardia that resolved spontaneously. Which of the following is the most likely etiology for this rhythm abnormality?</li>
                    <li>Which of the following radiographic abnormalities seen on CXR is suggestive of traumatic rupture of the aorta (TRA)?</li>
                    <li>A 36-year-old man is brought to the emergency department from the scene of a motor vehicle crash. He is found unconscious and is intubated in the field. Soon after intubation, he becomes hypotensive and is noted to have diminished right-sided breath sounds leading to right needle thoracostomy that improved his blood pressure. In the emergency center, he is noted to have extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and throughout the entire chest area. There is a moderate amount of blood in the endotracheal tube. A 40 French chest tube is placed on the right side. A subsequent CXR reveals a large right pneumothorax with proper chest tube positioning. The patient now has a large amount of air leakage associated with the right chest tube. His oxygen saturation on 100% FiO2 is 89%. What is the best treatment at this time?</li>
                    <li>A 33-year-old woman is brought to the emergency center after a high-speed head-on collision with another car traveling in the opposite direction. She is noted to be hemodynamically stable with tenderness over the anterior chest. The CXR is normal. She undergoes CT scan evaluation of the brain, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, where a 10% left pneumothorax is observed. After CT, she remains comfortable with respiratory rate of 24 and O2 saturation of 97% on room air. What of the following is the best treatment for her condition?</li>
                    <li>A 32-year-old man is brought to the emergency center from the scene of an automobile crash. He was unconscious at the scene and had witnessed bouts of emesis prompting orotracheal intubation in the field. At the time of his arrival to the emergency center, his pulse rate is 78, BP is 130/74, and GCS is 8T. His breath sounds are diminished on the left. His CXR in the emergency department revealed opacification of the left hemithorax with shifting of the mediastinum to the left. Which of the following is the best treatment for this condition?</li>
                    <li>A construction worker falls off a second story roof. He is brought to the emergency center. His blood pressure is 120/74, pulse is 100, respiratory rate is 22, and GCS is 14. His completed evaluation in the emergency center revealed a grade 2 splenic laceration with a small amount of fluid in the left upper quadrant. He also has six minimally-displaced rib fractures on the left, associated with flail chest and pulmonary contusion involving nearly 70% of the left lower lobe. The patient weighs approximately 70 kg. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient?</li>

                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>D. 18-year-old man with multiple blunt trauma including femur fractures develops hypoxia and respiratory distress. His lungs are clear bilaterally and his CXR is relatively normal. There are several possible explanations for his current clinical condition. Fat embolism and acute pulmonary embolism are the two most likely causes of respiratory distress that are associated with normal breath sounds and relatively normal CXR. Occult pneumothorax can have a normal CXR but is unlikely to produce respiratory compromise to this extent. Pulmonary contusion is generally associated with CXR opacification. ICU psychosis can cause confusion and anxiety but does not cause hypoxemia. Similarly, atelectasis can cause hypoxemia but the condition is often associated with CXR findings.</li>
                    <li>C. This man has multiple injuries secondary to a motorcycle crash. He has developed a brief period of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that has spontaneously resolved. Given his recent major injury mechanism and multiple rib fractures, the period of supraventricular arrhythmia is likely due to blunt cardiac injury. Pain and anxiety disorder can cause sinus tachycardia but not SVT. Caffeine can cause some arrhythmias but the SVT should not be attributed to that given the significant injuries that this patient has. Fat embolism is not often associated with any specific cardiac rhythm abnormalities.</li>
                    <li>D. Widened mediastinum along with left apical cap, obscured aortic knob, widening of the paravertebral stripe, downward deviation of the left mainstem bronchus, opacification of the aorto-pulmonary window, and rightward deviation of the NG tube are the CXR abnormalities associated with traumatic rupture of the aorta (TRA).</li>
                    <li>E. This man has extensive blunt chest injuries. Following intubation and the initiation of positive pressure ventilation, he develops tension pneumothorax on the right. With pleural decompression, the patient develops a large right-sided air leak and subcutaneous emphysema. He has persistence of right pneumothorax despite tube thoracostomy. At this time, he is becoming hypoxic from the air leakage and blood in the airway. His current findings and clinical course can be explained on the basis that he very likely has a major right-sided bronchial injury, which should be treated by a right thoracotomy and repair of the airway injury. If the injury is more proximally located in the trachea, the incision can be extended by a median sternotomy to gain access to the trachea.</li>
                    <li>A. This 33-year-old woman has an occult left pneumothorax following blunt chest trauma. Her pneumothorax is not seen by CXR and is only detected by CT scan. Observations from a large cohort of patients with occult pneumothoraces suggest that only 6% of the patients will develop worsening of the condition leading to chest tube placement. Patients on positive-pressure ventilation are at increased risk for this progression. The patient described here is comfortable, not in respiratory distress, and not on positive-pressure ventilation; therefore, close observation is appropriate.</li>
                    <li>D. This 32-year-old man is victim of a car crash who was intubated in the field because he was unconscious and vomiting. In the emergency center, his breath sounds are diminished on the left. The CXR obtained in the emergency center shows opacification of the left lung field with shifting of the mediastinum toward the left. These findings are compatible with either right mainstem bronchus intubation or a left bronchus obstructive process leading to collapse of the left lung and loss of left lung volume. It is reasonable to examine the CXR closely to see the position of the endotracheal tube, and if the tube appears to be too far in, we should adjust the position of the tube. Opacification of the hemithorax can also be caused by blood in that pleural space; however, if that were the case, there should not be a shift of the mediastinal structures toward the side of opacification.</li>
                    <li>C. This is a patient with splenic laceration, multiple rib fractures, flail chest, and a large pulmonary contusion. The management of this patient can be complicated, because he may need additional fluid/blood products for blood losses related to his splenic trauma, but at the same time his pulmonary contusion/flail chest would be better managed with relative fluid restriction and sufficient pain control. Because his blood pressure appears to be within normal range at this time, the choice selected offers a relatively low maintenance fluid rate, narcotic analgesia, and NSAID for pain control. The use of positive ventilatory support had been the cornerstone of flail chest management in the 1970s to 1980s, but it is no longer applied routinely except when patients develop respiratory failure and need mechanical ventilatory support.</li>

                <p>A 23-year-old restrained driver has sustained multiple injuries following a high-speed front-end motor vehicle collision with a truck. He presents with tachycardia, hypotension, and a GCS of 6. The patient’s initial assessment suggests the following injuries: traumatic brain injury, facial fractures, left pneumothorax, intra-abdominal injuries, and left femur fracture. The exact cause of the hypotension is unclear at this time, but should be presumed to be hypovolemia until proven otherwise.</p>

                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>Learn the priorities and principles in the treatment of patients with multiple injuries, including blunt chest injuries, abdominal trauma, TBI, orthopedic injuries, and possible spinal cord injury.</li>
                    <li>Learn to recognize the causes of hemodynamic instability in a trauma patient and learn the methods of diagnosis for these problems.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4 class="font-semibold">Considerations</h4>
                <p>This young man is brought in with injuries sustained in a high-speed front-end collision MVC. He is hypotensive, tachycardic and has a GCS of 6. Clinically, his examination is suspicious for left pneumothorax, facial fractures, and a left femur fracture. Intubation, oxygenation, and ventilation are important for a patient with high likelihood of having severe TBI. With the findings of diminished left-sided breath sounds and crepitance (subcutaneous emphysema) in the left chest wall, it is highly likely that the patient has a left pneumothorax and possibly a tension pneumothorax; therefore, immediate pleural decompression with chest tube placement is reasonable without first obtaining a CXR. Following chest tube placement, it is important to note if the patient’s breathing and circulation statuses improve with the intervention. If the breath sounds improve and blood pressure remain low, the next step would be to perform a focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) to determine if intra-abdominal hemorrhage is the cause of the hypotension. If the FAST reveals intraperitoneal free fluid, this unstable patient should be immediately taken to the OR for exploration and control of bleeding with an abbreviated laparotomy so that a CT of the brain can be obtained immediately following the control of intra-abdominal bleeding. If the FAST does not reveal evidence of pericardial effusion or intra-abdominal free fluid, we should then presume that the source of low blood pressure is due to blood loss secondary to his lacerations, facial fractures, and long bone fractures. Transfusion with blood products to help support the blood pressure is a reasonable initial treatment in this patient with suspected TBI, as the combination of TBI and hypotension contribute to worsening of TBI. Once the patient’s blood pressure is improved with blood products, our next priority would be to perform CT evaluation of the brain to further assess his traumatic brain injury. In many institutions, a pan-CT scan (brain, face, c-spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT) would be performed to identify all the potential injuries and allow prioritization of management. In general, the priorities of injury management go from addressing injuries that affect oxygenation/ventilation, to blood loss, to bony injuries. A possibility of his hypotension is caused by neurogenic shock (from high spinal cord injury) must be considered as the patient has not been witnessed to move his lower extremities following his injuries. Although neurogenic shock is a possibility, the patient’s current clinical picture is not exactly consistent with that diagnosis, due to his tachycardia.</p>
                <p>Because of the time requirement for completion and the need for patient transportation to an uncontrolled environment, CT imaging is contraindicated for unstable trauma patients.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Approach</h3>
                <h4 class="font-semibold">Definitions</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                    <li><strong>Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma (FAST):</strong> A quick ultrasound examination performed at the completion of the primary survey, designed to detect pericardial effusion and intra-abdominal free fluid. Four separate areas are evaluated, including the pericardial space, right upper quadrant subhepatic space, left upper quadrant perisplenic space, and pelvis. The FAST is especially helpful for evaluation of the hemodynamically unstable, multiple trauma patient.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage (DPL):</strong> The DPL is a bedside diagnostic procedure performed during the secondary survey in unstable patients to help identify intraperitoneal bleeding as the cause of the hypotension. Positive results can be based on aspiration of > 10 mL of blood or enteric contents from the peritoneal cavity. If no blood is aspirated, a liter of warm saline is infused into the peritoneal cavity through a catheter and then retrieved for cell count analysis. A microscopic positive lavage is WBC count > 500 cells/mm3 or RBC count of > 100,000 cells/mm3. The DPL is highly sensitive in identifying intraperitoneal bleeding; unfortunately, this study lacks specificity. In hemodynamically stable, blunt trauma patient with positive DPLs, the laparotomies can be nontherapeutic in up to 30% of the patients. Because of increased utility of the FAST, DPLs are less commonly used today.</li>
                    <li><strong>Abdominal CT Scan:</strong> A sensitive, specific diagnostic modality for solid organ injuries, retroperitoneal injuries, and peritoneal fluid in the blunt trauma setting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pan-CT Scan:</strong> In most institutions, the Pan-scan includes CT imaging of the brain, c-spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The use of the pan-scan was originally introduced in Europe and has been proven in many European trauma centers to help identify and triage the multiple injured patients. Pan-scan application is increasing in North American trauma centers.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="font-semibold">Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>The initial treatment begins with a primary survey consisting of airway (A), breathing (B), circulation (C), and D (disability) assessment and optimization that are commonly referred to as the ABCs. The primary survey focuses on immediate life-threatening problems, which should be promptly identified and treated. Once the ABCs are addressed satisfactorily, a secondary survey is conducted via a head-to-toe examination and inventory of all injuries. Nasogastric tube and urinary catheters if needed are placed at the end of the secondary survey. In the multiple injured patient, an AP chest x-ray and an AP pelvis x-ray can be helpful to identify conditions that may need immediate attention. For patients who are stable and without injuries in the chest or abdomen that require immediate attention, the next step would be to obtain CT evaluations to rule-out TBI, spine injuries, intrathoracic and intra-abdominal injuries. Whenever a trauma patient experiences a significant change in clinical condition, a thorough evaluation that begins with re-evaluation of the ABCs should be done to identify the cause of the clinical deterioration. If a patient has ongoing bleeding, TBI, and orthopedic injuries, the bleeding source needs to be addressed first prior to addressing the TBI, and lastly the orthopedic injuries. Generally, the treatment of major orthopedic injuries not associated with significant bleeding can be delayed until an initial period of stabilization for 24 to 48 hours. Many hemodynamically stable patients with hemoperitoneum, liver, spleen, or kidney injuries can be successfully managed by nonoperative management with close monitoring.</p>

                    <li>C. Pan-CT scan for trauma in most institutions consists of CT of brain, c-spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The use of pan-scans has been shown to help rapid triage of multiple-injured blunt trauma patients. CT is not a safe place for unstable patients; therefore, the pan-scan is not advisable for the evaluation of hemodynamically unstable patients. The pan-scan is not intended to replace the FAST examination.</li>
                    <li>A. Persistent hypotension in a patient with TBI contributes to secondary brain injury and worse neurologic outcomes.</li>
                    <li>B. This is a patient with possible TBI (Mild based on GCS of 13), and blunt right-sided chest trauma with physical examination findings that are suspicious for right pneumothorax or hemothorax. Because his GCS suggests that his TBI is not the major issue at this point, endotracheal intubation is not indicated. Placement of a right chest tube should be the first intervention to try to improve his breathing.</li>
                    <li>E. This man was the driver involved in an MVC with multiple injuries, including a left subdural hematoma with no midline shift and a GCS of 14, a 60% left pneumothorax, left tibia/fibula fracture with possible compromised circulation to the left foot, and scalp lacerations. The prioritization of his injuries management goes from treatment of the pneumothorax with chest tube placement, to supportive care and monitoring of his TBI, to reduction of the fractured left lower extremity to improve the circulatory status to the left lower extremity, to repair of his superficial scalp lacerations.</li>
                    <li>C. CT scan of the abdomen is highly sensitive and specific for solid organ injuries identification as well as retroperitoneal injuries identification. CT lacks sensitivity or specificity for hollow viscous injury identification. CT is not recommended for the evaluation of hemodynamically unstable patients.</li>
                    <li>E. This is a 73-year-old man who fell down a flight of stairs and presents with signs and symptoms compatible with having severe TBI with GCS of 6 and some evidence of left hemispheric mass effect leading to left papillary dilatation. Intubation and ventilation is important for this patient to minimize secondary brain injury. A FAST is helpful to rule-out significant blood loss given the finding of left flank bruising. It is critical to obtain a CT of the brain and at the same time alert the neurosurgeon that the patient may need emergency decompressive craniectomy.</li>

                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                    <li>To understand the approach to the management of hemorrhagic shock.</li>

                <h4 class="font-semibold">Considerations</h4>
                <p>The patient is a 20-year-old man who has sustained multiple gunshot wounds. The patient needs to be assessed quickly, resuscitated, and brought to the OR for definitive repair of his injuries as soon as possible. Each moment counts when a patient has sustained this type of injury. Every injured patient needs to be assessed based on the principles of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS). Each patient needs an initial assessment that includes the primary and secondary survey based on ATLS principles. The primary survey is geared to assess a patient quickly for life-threatening injuries and the secondary survey is a head-to-toe assessment of the patient’s current status. In addition, the patient needs to have operative intravenous lines placed and Foley catheter inserted as part of their initial assessment.</p>
