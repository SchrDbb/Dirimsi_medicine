                <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Brachial Plexus:</strong> A major peripheral nerve network formed by the anterior primary rami of the fifth cervical to the first thoracic spinal nerves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Upper Brachial Plexus Injury:</strong> Typically involves nerve roots C5 and C6, resulting in the upper limb hanging at the side, with medial rotation and the palm facing posteriorly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lower Brachial Plexus Injury:</strong> Less common injury involving C8 through T1 and the ulnar nerve, leading to interosseous muscle atrophy and claw hand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shoulder Dystocia:</strong> Condition whereby the fetal head delivers vaginally, but the shoulders are impacted behind the maternal bony pelvis.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The brachial plexus arises from the inferior portion of the cervical spinal cord enlargement, formed by the ventral primary rami of spinal nerves C5 through C8 and most of T1. The network is divided anatomically from proximal (medial) to distal (lateral) into roots, trunks, divisions, cords, and terminal branches (mnemonic: <em>Randy Travis Drinks Cold Texas Beer</em>). The roots emerge between the anterior and middle scalene muscles together with the subclavian artery. Arising from the roots are branches to the longus colli and scalene muscles and the dorsal scapular and long thoracic nerves. The roots unite to form superior, middle, and inferior trunks. The suprascapular nerve and the nerve to the subclavius muscle arise from the superior trunk. Each trunk divides into anterior and posterior divisions, which innervate musculature of the anterior and posterior compartments, respectively.</p>
                <p>The anterior divisions of the superior and middle trunks unite to form the lateral cord, which gives off the lateral pectoral nerve. The anterior division of the inferior trunk continues distally as the medial cord, with branches including the medial pectoral, medial brachial cutaneous, and medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves. The posterior divisions of all three trunks unite to form the posterior cord, with branches including the upper and lower subscapular and thoracodorsal nerves. The three cords are named for their relation to the axillary artery. The terminal branches of the brachial plexus are the axillary, musculocutaneous, median, ulnar, and radial nerves.</p>

                <h3>1.2 Clinical Case: Brachial Plexus Injury</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 32-year-old woman delivered a large (4800 g) baby vaginally after some difficulty with her labor. Her prenatal course was complicated by diabetes, which occurred during pregnancy. At delivery, the infant’s head emerged, but the shoulders were “stuck” behind the maternal symphysis pubis, requiring the obstetrician to apply some effort and maneuvers to free up the infant’s shoulders and complete the delivery. The infant was noted to have a good cry and pink color but was not moving its right arm.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Brachial plexus injury, probably Erb palsy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Most likely etiology:</strong> Stretching of the upper brachial plexus during delivery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Likely anatomical mechanism:</strong> Stretching of nerve roots C5 and C6 by an abnormal increase in the angle between the neck and the shoulder.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A large (4800 g) infant of a diabetic mother is delivered after some difficulty and cannot move its right arm due to shoulder dystocia (the infant’s shoulders are stuck after delivery of the head).</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> During delivery, particularly of a large infant, shoulder dystocia may occur, where the fetal head emerges, but the shoulders become wedged behind the maternal symphysis pubis. Obstetricians use maneuvers such as flexion of the maternal hips against the maternal abdomen (McRobert maneuver) or fetal maneuvers like pushing the fetal shoulders into an oblique position to allow delivery without excessive traction on the fetal neck. Despite these maneuvers, infants may sustain stretch injuries to the brachial plexus, resulting in nerve palsies. The most common is an upper brachial plexus stretch injury affecting nerve roots C5 and C6, causing the infant’s arm to hang limp at its side. Most such injuries resolve spontaneously.</p>
                <p><strong>Discussion:</strong> The axillary nerve (C5 and C6) arises from the posterior cord and courses around the surgical neck of the humerus, accompanied by the posterior circumflex humeral artery. It supplies the deltoid and teres minor muscles and is sensory to the skin over the lower deltoid, tested at the “shoulder patch” area. Axillary nerve injury, such as from a humeral surgical neck fracture, results in inability to abduct the arm to a horizontal position and sensory loss in the shoulder patch area.</p>
                <p>The musculocutaneous nerve (C5–C7), a continuation of the lateral cord, courses through the coracobrachialis muscle to innervate it, the biceps brachii, and brachialis muscles. Its terminal branch, the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve, provides sensation to the lateral forearm. Damage causes weakness in shoulder and elbow flexion and supination.</p>
                <p>Upper brachial plexus injuries (C5–C6) affect the superior trunk, impacting the axillary, musculocutaneous, lateral pectoral, suprascapular, and nerve to the subclavius. These injuries often occur during obstetrical delivery or falls that widen the shoulder-neck angle, paralyzing abductors (deltoid, supraspinatus) and flexors (biceps brachii, coracobrachialis), resulting in an adducted, medially rotated arm with an extended elbow and pronated hand (“waiter’s tip” sign). Sensory loss occurs along the C5–C6 dermatomes.</p>
                <p>The ulnar nerve (C8–T1), a continuation of the medial cord, innervates the flexor carpi ulnaris, flexor digitorum profundus (ring and little fingers), and most intrinsic hand muscles except the thenar muscles and lumbricals of the index and middle fingers. It is sensory to the medial hand, little finger, and medial ring finger. Damage causes radial deviation of the hand, weakness in wrist flexion/adduction, and loss of finger abduction/adduction, leading to a “claw hand” deformity.</p>
                <p>Lower brachial plexus injuries (Klumpke palsy) result from traction widening the angle between the upper extremity and thorax, affecting C8–T1 roots or the inferior trunk, impacting the ulnar and median nerves. This causes weakness in anterior forearm and hand muscles, with sensory loss along the C8–T1 dermatomes. Compression of the brachial plexus cords, such as from prolonged hyperabduction or an overly long axillary crutch, can cause radial nerve palsy.</p>

                <p>The radial nerve is a continuation of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, reaching the posterior compartment of the arm by coursing around the radial groove of the humerus with the deep brachial artery. It gives off multiple muscular branches to the triceps muscle in the posterior compartment. The nerve then pierces the lateral intermuscular septum to return to the anterior compartment of the arm and descends to the level of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, lying deep to the brachioradialis muscle, where it divides into its two terminal branches. The deep branch of the radial nerve is entirely motor to the muscles of the posterior compartment of the forearm. The superficial branch is sensory to the dorsum of the hand and to the dorsum of the thumb, index finger, and the radial side of the middle finger. The radial nerve also has cutaneous sensory branches to the posterior and lateral arm and to the posterior forearm.</p>
                <p>The blood supply to the upper limb is derived from the brachial artery, a direct continuation of the axillary artery. It begins at the lower border of the teres major muscle and accompanies the median nerve on the medial aspect of the humerus, where its pulsations can be palpated or the artery occluded to control hemorrhage. It gives off the deep brachial artery, which supplies the posterior compartment of the arm and passes around the radial groove with the radial nerve. It also has ulnar collateral branches to the elbow joint. The brachial artery shifts anteriorly as it enters the forearm, lying just medial to the tendon of the biceps brachii muscle in the cubital fossa. At about the level of the neck of the radius, it divides into the ulnar and radial arteries, the main arteries of the forearm and hand. Near their origin, each sends recurrent arterial branches to supply the elbow joint.</p>
                <p>The radial artery supplies the lateral aspects of the forearm and at the wrist passes dorsally through the anatomical snuff box to become the deep palmar arch. The ulnar artery, the larger branch, supplies the medial aspect of the forearm. A branch close to its origin, the common interosseous artery, divides into anterior and posterior interosseous arteries, the latter being the main blood supply to the posterior compartment. At the wrist, the ulnar artery enters the hand to form the superficial palmar arch. The superficial and deep palmar arches form an arterial anastomosis and give rise to arteries to the digits.</p>

                <h3>2.2 Clinical Case: Radial Nerve Injury</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 32-year-old man is involved in a motor vehicle accident. He used three-point restraints and was driving a sedan. The driver of a pick-up truck ran a stop sign while going at approximately 45 mph and “T-boned” the patient’s vehicle on the driver’s side. The patient has multiple injuries, including a displaced fracture of the left humerus. He complains of an inability to open his left hand and loss of sensation to a portion of his left hand.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Injury to the radial nerve as it spirals around the humerus, resulting in an inability to extend the wrist or fingers and loss of sensation of the hand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Likely mechanism:</strong> Stretch or crush injury to the radial nerve as it spirals around the midshaft of the humerus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Likely location of sensory deficit:</strong> Radial (lateral) side of the dorsum of the hand and dorsum of the thumb and index and middle digits.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 32-year-old man is involved in a motor vehicle accident that causes a displaced fracture of the left humerus. He has motor and sensory losses to his left hand.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> The radial nerve is at particular risk of injury in its course in the radial groove as it spirals around the midshaft of the humerus. Humeral fractures involving the midshaft region are of particular concern. There is loss of innervation of the posterior extensor muscles in the forearm, resulting in wrist drop and an inability to extend the digits at the metacarpophalangeal joints. The sensory loss on the dorsum of the hand and digits reflects the distal cutaneous distribution of the radial nerve. The triceps muscle (extensor of the elbow) is typically spared; however, the patient usually will not attempt to move the limb due to pain from the fracture. The deep brachial artery has the same path as the radial nerve in the radial groove and has a similar risk for injury.</p>

                    <li><strong>Anatomical Snuff Box:</strong> Depression on the lateral aspect of the wrist formed by the tendons of the extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus anteriorly and the extensor pollicis longus posteriorly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fracture:</strong> A break in the normal integrity of a bone or cartilage.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The junction of the forearm and hand, called the wrist region, is a complex of several joints. The articulation of the distal radius with the ulna, called the distal radioulnar joint, is the site of movement of the radius anteriorly around the ulna during pronation. The radius and ulna are united by an articular disc or triangular fibrocartilage and associated ligaments, which intervenes between the ulna and carpal bones. The wrist joint proper is formed between the distal radius, the triangular fibrocartilage, and the proximal row of carpal bones. The eight carpal bones are arranged in proximal and distal rows of four bones each. From lateral to medial, the proximal row is composed of the scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, pisiform, and the distal row of the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, hamate (mnemonic: <em>some ladies try perfume that they can’t handle</em>). Approximately 50 percent of movement at the wrist occurs at the wrist joint proper, with the remaining 50 percent occurring at the intercarpal joint, between the two rows of carpal bones. A capsule, reinforced by palmar and dorsal radiocarpal ligaments, surrounds the joint. The radial collateral ligament strengthens the capsule laterally and limits adduction (ulnar deviation). The ulnar collateral ligament strengthens the capsule medially and limits abduction (radial deviation).</p>
                <p>In addition to the distal radioulnar joint, the proximal radioulnar joint allows pivot movement of the radius with the humerus and the ulna during pronation and supination. The radius and ulna are also joined by the interosseous membrane and its fibers to form a syndesmosis. The individual fibers are attached proximally on the radius but distally on the ulna. Impact forces on an outstretched hand are transmitted at the wrist to the radius, through the interosseous membrane to the ulna, to the humerus, and then to the shoulder, which is attached to the trunk primarily by muscle. In this fashion, impact forces are transferred distally in the upper limb, with dissipation of the forces as they move proximally. A fall on an outstretched hand may cause fracture of the radial head under the right circumstances. Fracture of one forearm bone frequently results in dislocation of the other bone through forces transferred by the interosseous membrane: wrist → radius → interosseous membrane → ulna → humerus.</p>
                <p>The anatomical snuff box is bounded anteriorly by the tendons of the abductor pollicis longus and the extensor pollicis brevis and posteriorly by the tendon of the extensor pollicis longus. The scaphoid bone and the radial artery (a branch of which supplies the scaphoid) lie in the floor of the snuff box.</p>

                <p>A 23-year-old male reports that he was playing “hoops” with friends from college, tripped as he was driving to the basket, and fell on his outstretched right hand with the palm down. Two days later, he phoned his anatomist father and related that his right wrist was painful. Later that day, he visited his father who noted that the wrist was slightly swollen, tender, but without deformity. He instructed his son to extend the right thumb, thereby accentuating the anatomical “snuff box,” which is extremely tender to deep palpation. His father told him a radiograph is needed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Wrist fracture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Most likely anatomical defect:</strong> Fracture of the narrow middle portion of the scaphoid carpal bone.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 23-year-old male trips while playing basketball and suffers trauma to the right wrist. The wrist is slightly swollen, tender, but not deformed. However, deep palpation of the anatomical snuff box elicits extreme tenderness.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This young man tripped while playing basketball and stretched out his right hand to protect himself. His hand, with the palm down and probably deviated to the side of the radius, took the brunt of the fall, resulting in significant impact force to the wrist. This results in pain and swelling of the wrist, especially on the radial side, with point tenderness deep in the anatomical snuff box. This is the common mechanism for a fracture of the scaphoid carpal bone, the most commonly fractured carpal bone. Point tenderness over a bone or bony process is a hallmark of a fracture at that site. Radiologic confirmation of a fracture is important. The scaphoid bone has a unique blood supply, and proper reduction and alignment of the segments is necessary to decrease the risk of avascular necrosis. A fall on an outstretched hand in a way that produces hyperextension of the wrist may result in dislocation of the lunate bone. The lunate is usually displaced anteriorly into the carpal tunnel and may impinge on the median nerve. The lunate is the most commonly dislocated carpal bone. A fall on an outstretched palm may also result in a transverse fracture of the distal radius or a Colles fracture. A Colles fracture produces a dorsal displacement of the distal fragment, resulting in the characteristic “dinner fork” deformity. A Smith fracture of the radius in the same region of younger individuals is less common. In a Smith fracture, there is trauma to the dorsal aspect of a flexed wrist, and the wrist is deformed with the distal radial fragment displaced ventrally in a “spade” deformity.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>The carpal tunnel is formed posteriorly by the concave surfaces of the carpal bones. The anterior boundary of the tunnel is formed by a thickening of the deep fascia, the flexor retinaculum (transverse carpal ligament). The flexor retinaculum is attached laterally to the tubercles of the scaphoid and trapezium and medially to the pisiform and hook of the hamate. The carpal tunnel is a passageway for the nine tendons and their investing synovial sheaths of the flexor muscles of the thumb and fingers: four tendons each of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP), the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus (FPL), and the median nerve. The flexor retinaculum (and the extensor retinaculum dorsally) prevent “bowstringing” of the tendons of the extrinsic hand muscles at the wrist.</p>
                <p>The median nerve (C6 through T1) is formed by contributions from the lateral and medial cords. It passes distally along the arm with the brachial artery and enters the cubital fossa medial to that artery. The nerve is at some risk in the cubital fossa region. It enters the forearm by passing between the heads of the pronator teres muscle and then descends in the forearm between the FDS and the FDP. In the forearm, the nerve innervates all the muscles of the anterior compartment except the flexor carpi ulnaris and the bellies of the FDP to the ring and little fingers. As it approaches the carpal tunnel at the wrist, the median nerve lies just medial to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle and slightly posterior to the tendon of the palmaris longus muscle, if present. The median nerve enters the hand through the carpal tunnel together with the tendons of the FDS, FDP, and FPL and is at risk of laceration at the wrist and of compression within the carpal tunnel, deep to the flexor retinaculum.</p>
                <p>Typically, the recurrent branch of the median nerve arises distal to the flexor retinaculum and the tunnel to innervate the three thenar muscles: flexor pollicis brevis, abductor pollicis brevis, and opponens pollicis. The lumbrical muscles of the index and middle fingers receive their motor branches from adjacent common palmar digital branches. The remainder of the median nerve divides into the common palmar digital nerves to the skin of the thumb and the index, middle, and radial side of the ring fingers, including their dorsal nail beds. The skin of the palm of the hand and thenar eminence is supplied by the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve, which typically arises from the median nerve in the distal forearm and does not traverse the carpal tunnel. Intact skin sensation in the palm of the hand suggests carpal tunnel entrapment of the median nerve, whereas loss of palmar skin sensation suggests a higher nerve lesion.</p>
                <p>The ulnar nerve, which innervates all the other intrinsic hand muscles, enters the hand anterior to the flexor retinaculum with and medial to the ulnar artery. The artery and nerve are covered anteriorly by a condensation of the fascia of the forearm, called the volar carpal ligament. Thus, the ulnar nerve and artery come to lie in the Guyon canal, bounded anteriorly by the volar carpal ligament, posteriorly by the flexor retinaculum, medially by the pisiform, and laterally by the hook of the hamate.</p>

                <h3>4.2 Clinical Case: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 34-year-old pregnant woman complains of tingling of her right index and middle fingers over a 2-month duration. She notes some weakness of her right hand and has begun to drop items such as her coffee cup. She has otherwise been healthy and denies any trauma or neck pain.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Carpal tunnel syndrome.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical mechanism:</strong> Compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel of the wrist.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A pregnant woman has tingling and weakness of her right index and middle fingers.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> The most likely cause for this individual’s symptoms is carpal tunnel syndrome. The carpal tunnel is a confined, rigid space at the wrist that contains nine tendons with their synovial sheaths and the median nerve. Any condition that further reduces the available space within the tunnel may compress the median nerve, producing numbness and pain in the areas of cutaneous distribution, muscle weakness (especially in the thumb), and muscle atrophy after long-term compression. The median nerve may be compressed in several sites along its length between the brachial plexus and the hand, but the carpal tunnel is the most common site. Carpal tunnel syndrome has been associated with endocrine conditions such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, acromegaly, and pregnancy. Other causes include autoimmune disease, lipomas within the canal, hematomas, and carpal bone abnormalities. Females are more commonly affected than males in a ratio of 3:1. Initial treatment is a nighttime splint of the wrist and avoidance of excessive activity with the hand. If symptoms do not decrease, division of the flexor retinaculum (carpal tunnel release) may be necessary.</p>
                <p><strong>Discussion:</strong> Damage to the median nerve in the upper forearm results in loss of pronation, weakness in flexion at the wrist, and medial (ulnar) deviation. There will also be loss of flexion at the proximal interphalangeal joint of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers and loss of flexion at the distal interphalangeal joints of the index and middle fingers. Damage to the median nerve in the upper forearm or at the wrist will also result in loss of flexion, abduction, and opposition of the thumb, and flexion at the metacarpal phalangeal joints of the index and middle fingers. Loss of the median nerve results in the “hand of benediction” when the patient is asked to make a fist and an “ape hand” due to longstanding injury with atrophy of the thenar muscles.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>The shoulder girdle and shoulder joint proper are composed of the clavicle, scapula, and the proximal portion of the humerus. The only bony articulation between the shoulder girdle and the trunk occurs at the sternoclavicular joint. This strong joint has two joint spaces created by a cartilage articular disc. The synovial articulation of the clavicle with the manubrium of the sternum is strengthened by a joint capsule, anterior and posterior sternoclavicular, and interclavicular and costoclavicular ligaments. The lateral end of the clavicle articulates with the acromion of the scapula to form the acromioclavicular joint. An incomplete articular disc is present within this synovial joint. A thin, loose capsule surrounds the acromioclavicular joint, which is reinforced superiorly by an acromioclavicular ligament, but its chief strength and support is derived from the trapezoid and conoid ligaments, which together form the coracoclavicular ligament.</p>
                <p>The articulation of the glenoid cavity on the neck of the scapula with the head of the humerus forms the glenohumeral joint. This shallow ball-and-socket synovial joint forms the shoulder joint proper. The anatomy of this joint allows a wide range of motion, although stability is decreased. The diameter of the humeral head is about three times greater than the diameter of the glenoid cavity, which is increased somewhat by a rim of fibrocartilage attached to the margin of the glenoid, the glenoid labrum. The joint capsule attaches to the margin of the glenoid proximally and to the anatomical neck of the humerus distally. The capsule has openings for the tendon of the long head of the biceps muscle and for the subscapular bursa, which communicates with the joint cavity. Three glenohumeral ligaments, band-like thickenings of the anterior capsule, are identifiable only internally. The coracohumeral ligament reinforces the capsule superiorly, and the transverse humeral ligament bridges the intertubercular groove with the tendon and synovial sheath of the long head of the biceps brachii muscle. The roof of the glenohumeral joint is formed by the inferior surface of the acromion and the coracoacromial ligament.</p>
                <p>The upper limb is attached to the trunk primarily by muscles. This group of muscles, the extrinsic muscles of the shoulder, originates from the trunk and inserts onto the scapula in most instances or the humerus directly. The action of muscles attaching to the scapula produces movement of the scapula, which greatly increases the range of motion at the shoulder. The extrinsic muscles and their action and innervation are listed below:</p>

Nevertheless, the supraspinatus tendon is typically damaged with rotator cuff tears.</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 17-year-old defensive end was attempting to tackle a fullback with an outstretched left arm. The arm was hit with substantial force, and he now complains of severe shoulder pain and his left arm is hanging down with some external rotation. He does not move the limb due to the pain. A radiograph is negative for a fracture, but the head of the humerus is superimposed on the neck of the scapula.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Glenohumeral joint dislocation (shoulder dislocation).</li>
                    <li><strong>Most likely nerve injured:</strong> Axillary nerve.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 17-year-old football player’s left arm was outstretched and hit with some force. He has shoulder pain, and his arm hangs down his side with external rotation. There is no fracture, and the humeral head is superimposed on the scapular neck.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> The shoulder is the most commonly dislocated large joint of the body, and is most commonly dislocated in an anterior direction. Typically, the dislocation is also inferior such that the humeral head is located inferior and lateral to the coracoid process. The humeral head will often have an infraglenoid and infraclavicular position. The diagnosis may be difficult to make. The typical mechanism is that of a violent force to the humerus that is abducted and externally rotated, resulting in extension of the joint; this action displaces the humeral head inferiorly, thus tearing the weak inferior portion of the shoulder joint capsule. This is facilitated by the fulcrum effect of the acromion. The strong flexor and adductor muscles pull the humeral head anteriorly and medially to the usual subcoracoid position. In general, the patient will not move the arm and will support the limb flexed at the elbow with the opposite hand. The arm will be slightly abducted and medially rotated. The usually rounded curve of the shoulder is lost, and there is a depression evident inferior to the acromion. The humeral head is palpable, if not visible, in the deltopectoral triangle. First priorities are assessment of the neural and vascular integrity of the upper limb by testing motor and sensory functions of the fingers and palpation of the radial pulse. Different methods to reduce the dislocation exist, including the modified Hippocratic method in which one operator pulls on a sheet placed around the thorax of the patient, while a second operator gently puts traction on the wrist of the affected side. Other injuries that may accompany a shoulder dislocation include strain on the tendons of the subscapularis and supraspinatus muscles, tears of the glenoid labrum, fracture of the greater tubercle of the humerus, trauma to the axillary nerve (as demonstrated by loss of sensation in the shoulder patch region over the deltoid muscle), and trauma to the axillary artery or its branches such as the posterior circumflex humeral or subscapular arteries.</p>

                </ul>
                <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hip Bone:</strong> Os coxae, irregular flat bone formed by the fusion of the pubis, ilium, and ischium.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hip Joint:</strong> Joint formed by the acetabulum and the head of the femur.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sciatic Nerve:</strong> The largest nerve of the body, formed from the sacral plexus by the ventral rami of L4 through S3, and anatomically unites the common fibular and tibial nerves.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The hip joint is a unique ball-and-socket joint formed by the femur and hip bone that combines stability for the transference of weight to the lower limbs and enables an erect posture, with a wide range of motion. The ball portion of the joint is formed by the head of the femur and is angled superomedially to the shaft by the neck. The large adjacent greater and lesser trochanters serve as points of attachment for muscles acting across the hip joint. The socket portion of the joint is formed by the cup-shaped acetabulum on the lateral surface of the hip bone (os coxae). The hip bone is formed by the fused ilium, ischium, and pubic bones, all of which participate in forming the acetabulum. The depth of the acetabulum is increased by a C-shaped rim of fibrocartilage called the acetabular labrum. The incomplete inferior portion of the labrum, the acetabular notch, is completed by the transverse acetabular ligament, and the weak, intra-articular ligament of the femoral head passes from the head to the acetabulum adjacent to the notch. The femoral head and acetabulum are covered with articular cartilage.</p>
                <p>The hip joint is surrounded by a capsule, lined with a synovial membrane, and strengthened by three ligamentous thickenings, named for their proximal attachments. The capsule is reinforced anteriorly and superiorly by the strong, inverted Y-shaped iliofemoral ligament. Inferior and posterior capsular thickenings are the pubofemoral and ischiofemoral ligaments, respectively. The blood supply to the hip joint comes from the lateral and medial circumflex arteries, typically branches of the deep femoral artery, with the medial circumflex artery being the most important. These vessels reach the femoral head along the neck, where they are at risk with femoral neck fractures. A small artery of the head (a branch of the obturator artery) runs within the ligament of the head.</p>
                <p>In addition to producing movement at the hip joint, the muscles crossing the joint impart much of the joints’ stability while standing erect. The movements at the hip joint and the muscles (with their innervation) producing these movements are listed below:</p>

                <p>The large sciatic nerve exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen and enters the deep gluteal region immediately inferior to the piriformis muscle. The sciatic nerve is actually the combined common fibular nerve (lateral portion) and the tibial nerve (medial portion). The common fibular nerve innervates the lateral compartment muscles (superficial fibular branch) and the anterior compartment muscles (deep fibular branch) of the leg. The tibial portion innervates the muscles of posterior compartments of the thigh and leg (calf) and the sole of the foot. The sciatic nerve lies posterior to the hip joint.</p>

                <h3>6.2 Clinical Case: Posterior Hip Dislocation</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 37-year-old male accountant is picked up by his wife at his office. He gets into the passenger seat of their automobile and turns to get the safety belt as his wife begins to exit the parking lot. Another vehicle entering the lot strikes their vehicle head on, and he is thrown forward by the sudden deceleration. His left knee strikes the dashboard violently, and he feels a painful pop in his left hip. After ambulance transport to the hospital emergency department, he is noted to have great pain in the left hip region. Compared with his right leg, he is noted to have a shortened left lower limb that is adducted and medially rotated. There is a painful mass in the lateral gluteal region.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Posterior hip dislocation, with or without acetabular fracture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structures involved:</strong> Hip joint, including the femoral head, joint capsule and ligaments, and acetabulum.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structures at risk:</strong> Sciatic nerve.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 37-year-old male automobile passenger was turning to his right during a head-on collision, in which his left knee struck the dashboard. He experiences a painful pop in his left hip. His left hip is very painful, and his left lower limb is shortened, adducted, and medially rotated. A large painful mass is present in the lateral gluteal area.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This male automobile passenger has suffered a deceleration injury in which his left knee has forcefully impacted the vehicle’s dashboard, forcing the femoral head posteriorly over the rim of the acetabulum. As he turned to reach for the safety belt, his hip was flexed by his sitting position, adducted and medially rotated, the classic hip position for this type of injury. The painful pop was the femoral head tearing through the posterior joint capsule and ligaments. The painful lateral gluteal mass is the femoral head on the lateral aspect of the ilium, and the limb appears short due to the abnormal position of the femoral head. The first step would be radiographic confirmation of the dislocation or dislocation fracture. This would be followed by urgent reduction of the dislocation to decrease the risk of avascular necrosis of the femoral head and other complications such as posttraumatic arthritis. Fracture repair, if present, may be performed at a later time.</p>

                <h3>7.1 Approach to the Knee Joint</h3>
                <p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Describe the anatomy of the knee joint, including the bones, ligaments, possible movements, and the muscles responsible for these movements.</li>
                    <li>Describe the mechanism of injury to the four main ligaments of the knee.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Knee:</strong> Hinge joint between the femur and proximal tibia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Patella:</strong> A triangular bone approximately 5 cm in diameter situated in the front of the knee at the insertion of the quadriceps tendons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meniscus:</strong> Crescent-shaped intra-articular cartilage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The knee joint is a synovial hinge joint formed by the distal femur, proximal tibia, and the patella. It is a relatively stable joint; its movements consist primarily of flexion and extension, with some gliding, rolling, and locking rotation. The distal femur forms two large knuckle-like lateral and medial condyles, which articulate with lateral and medial tibial condyles. The superior surfaces of the tibial condyles are flattened to form the tibial plateau. An intercondylar eminence fits between the femoral condyles, and the proximal fibula articulates with the lateral tibial condyle but is not a part of the knee joint. The patella articulates with the femur anteriorly. The flat tibial condylar surfaces are modified to accommodate the femoral condyles by the C-shaped lateral and medial menisci. These fibrocartilaginous structures are wedge-shaped in cross section, being thick externally but thin internally, are firmly attached to the tibial condyles, and serve as shock absorbers. The lateral meniscus is the smaller of the two, being somewhat circular, whereas the medial meniscus is C-shaped. The femoral and remaining portions of the tibial condyles are covered with articular cartilage.</p>
                <p>The knee joint is surrounded by a capsule, lined with synovial membrane, and reinforced by several ligamentous thickenings. Anteriorly, the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle group has the patella embedded within it. Inferior to the patella, the tendon becomes the patellar ligament, which inserts into the tibial tuberosity. Laterally, the capsule is thickened to form the fibular (lateral) collateral ligament from the lateral femoral epicondyle to the fibular head. The fibular collateral ligament remains separated from the lateral meniscus by the tendon of the popliteus muscle. It prevents increasing the lateral angle or adduction of the leg at the knee. The tibial (medial or MCL) collateral ligament extends from the medial femoral epicondyle to the medial tibial condyle. The deep aspect of this ligament is firmly attached to the margin of the medial meniscus. It prevents increasing the medial angle or abduction of the leg at the knee. Posteriorly, the capsule is reinforced by oblique and arcuate popliteal ligaments. The knee is unique due to the presence of two intra-articular ligaments, the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). The cruciate ligaments are covered by synovial membrane and thus are external to the synovial cavity and are named by their attachment to the tibia. The ACL extends from the anterior tibial plateau near the intercondylar eminence to the posteromedial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. It limits anterior displacement of the tibia in relation to the femur and limits hyperextension. The PCL extends from the posterior aspect of the tibial plateau to the anterolateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle. In its course, it crosses the ACL on its medial side and is larger and stronger than the ACL. The PCL limits posterior displacement of the tibia on the femur and limits hyperflexion. A dozen or so bursae are associated with the knee joint, and four of these communicate with the synovial cavity of the joint: suprapatellar, popliteus, anserine, and gastrocnemius. Thus, inflammation of any of these bursae (bursitis) will likely result in swelling of the entire knee joint. The knee joint is richly supplied by several genicular and recurrent arteries from the femoral, popliteal, and anterior tibial arteries.</p>
                <p>Additional strength and stability to the knee joint are provided by the muscles that cross and produce movement at the joint. The action and innervation of these muscles are listed below:</p>

                </table>
                <p>An abnormal force applied to the lateral aspect of the knee with the foot planted stretches the tibial (MCL) collateral ligament, causing a sprain or, if forceful enough, rupture of this ligament. The exposed lateral knee makes this injury more frequent. Because the medial meniscus is firmly attached to the deep surface of the tibial collateral ligament, it also is frequently damaged. Forces applied to the medial aspect of the knee can damage the fibular (lateral) collateral ligament in a similar manner. However, because the lateral meniscus is not attached to the ligament, it typically is not damaged. Excessive force to the anterior aspect of the tibia will move it posteriorly, thus stretching or tearing the PCL. The ACL is most often damaged when forces or activities produce hyperextension of the knee.</p>

                <h3>7.2 Clinical Case: Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 25-year-old woman is on her first ski trip to Colorado. She has advanced from the “bunny slopes” and, during the last run of the day, falls and twists her right leg. She cannot stand on her right leg due to pain and is brought down the hill in a snow mobile. On examination, the right knee is swollen and tender. With the patient sitting on the stretcher with her knee flexed, the lower leg seems to have several centimeters of excess anterior mobility.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mechanism of injury:</strong> Excessive rotational force strains or ruptures the ligament.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 25-year-old woman twists her right lower limb in a ski accident. She has right knee swelling, tenderness, and excessive anterior mobility with the knee flexed.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Injuries to the knee are very common because it bears weight, combines mobility in flexion and extension, and allows some rotation. The stability of the knee depends entirely on its ligaments and muscles. Sports injuries to the knee are most commonly caused by high-speed and rotational forces applied to the leg through the knee joint. In addition, certain ligaments are anatomically related to the menisci, on which the distal femur articulates. This 25-year-old woman was involved in a ski injury, a common setting for ACL injury. The twisting force to the lower limb when a ski becomes lodged in snow and the body continues to rotate can produce significant trauma to the knee. The ACL passes from the posterior aspect of the distal femur to the intercondylar region of the anterior aspect of the proximal tibia; it limits anterior movement of the tibia in relation to the femur. Thus, on examination, this patient exhibits the “anterior drawer sign,” or excessive anterior mobility of the tibia with the knee flexed. This injury will usually require surgical repair.</p>

                    <li><strong>Epidural:</strong> The space external to the spinal cord’s dura mater; anesthetic agents are injected into this space for epidural anesthesia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nerve compression:</strong> Pressure on a nerve such that neural transmission is temporarily blocked.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dorsiflexion:</strong> Decrease in the angle between the lower leg and foot, as with walking on one’s heels; the opposite of plantarflexion, as standing on tip toe.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The sciatic nerve (L4–S3) is the largest nerve in the body, arising from the lumbosacral plexus. It exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen, inferior to the piriformis muscle. The sciatic nerve is actually two nerves, the tibial (medial) and common fibular (lateral) nerves, loosely bound together by connective tissue. The tibial nerve is derived from the anterior division of the anterior rami, while the common fibular is derived from the posterior division of the anterior rami. No muscles of the gluteal region are innervated by the sciatic nerve. It descends in the posterior compartment of the thigh where its tibial nerve innervates all the muscles (hip extensors and knee flexors) of the posterior thigh except the short head of the biceps femoris (innervated by the common fibular nerve). At approximately the superior angle of the popliteal fossa, the tibial and common fibular portions separate.</p>
                <p>The common fibular nerve passes laterally, superficially, and courses around the neck of the fibula subcutaneously where it is at risk of injury or compression. It then divides into its superficial fibular nerve, which innervates the fibular muscles (evertors) of the lateral compartment of the leg, and the skin of the lateral leg and dorsum of the foot. The deep fibular nerve enters the anterior compartment of the leg, and innervates the muscles of this compartment (dorsiflexors), intrinsic dorsal foot muscles, and the skin between the great and second toe. Severing the deep fibular nerve results in a foot drop.</p>
                <p>The tibial nerve descends through the popliteal fossa, and enters the posterior compartment of the leg to innervate the posterior compartment muscles (plantarflexors and invertors). It also gives off a medial sural branch which joins the communicating sural branch of the common fibular to form the sural nerve which is sensory to the posterior aspect of the leg and lateral foot. At the level of the posterior malleolus, the tibial nerve divides into the lateral and medial plantar nerves which innervate the intrinsic muscles and skin of the sole of the foot. Severing the tibial nerve in the leg results in an inability to stand on tip toes.</p>
                <p>The femoral nerve (L2–4) arises from the lumbar plexus. It exits the abdomen posterior to the inguinal ligament, and lies lateral and outside the femoral sheath and its contents. It innervates the muscles (hip flexors and knee extensors) of the anterior compartment of the thigh, and the skin of the anterior thigh and medial leg. The obturator nerve (L2–4) exits the abdomen through the obturator canal, and enters the medial compartment of the thigh to innervate these muscles (adductors), and a patch of skin on the medial side of the thigh.</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 23-year-old female is seen on the postpartum floor the day after delivering a 9-pound baby boy. She is concerned about her right foot which has become numb and weak since delivering the baby. Walking has been difficult for her because her right foot tends to drop and her toes drag. When asked about her labor course, she reports that she had an epidural with satisfactory pain relief but a difficult and prolonged pushing stage of labor (3 hours) in stirrups. She denies any back pain or problems with the other leg. On exam, she has decreased sensation on the top of right foot and lateral side of the lower leg along with an inability to dorsiflex the right foot, resulting in a foot drop. Minimal peripheral edema is seen in both lower extremities.</p>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Factors leading to injury:</strong> Prolonged compression of common fibular nerve by stirrups and flexion at the knee.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 23-year-old female postpartum day 1 with right foot weakness, numbness, and foot drop after a difficult vaginal delivery.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Compression of the common fibular nerve during labor is the most common postpartum nerve injury of the lower extremity. Compression of the common fibular nerve occurs from both the flexion of the knees and compression from stirrups on the lateral aspect of the knee. The common fibular nerve may also be injured during knee surgery, trauma, or prolonged periods of compression (coma, deep sleep, lower extremity cast). Because of the epidural anesthesia, the patient likely felt no pain from the prolonged compression. Injury to the common fibular nerve causes numbness, weakness to the lower leg/foot, and foot drop (inability to dorsiflex foot). The majority of compression injuries after delivery are self-limiting and improve with supportive care. Proper positioning of the patient requires a good understanding of anatomy to avoid periods of prolonged nerve compression.</p>

                    <li>Describe the deep and superficial venous drainage of the lower limb.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Afebrile:</strong> Without fever.</li>
                    <li><strong>Embolus:</strong> A mass such as part of the blood clot (thrombus), air, or fat that travels through a vessel and lodges and obstructs the blood flow.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The chief blood supply to the lower limb is from the femoral artery, the continuation of the external iliac artery inferior to the inguinal ligament, within the femoral triangle. The femoral triangle is bounded by the inguinal ligament superiorly, the sartorius muscle laterally, and the adductor longus muscle medially. It contains the femoral nerve and the femoral sheath and its contents. The femoral artery lies in the lateral compartment of the femoral sheath, with the femoral vein medial to it, and the femoral canal with its associated inguinal lymph nodes medial to the vein. The femoral nerve lies lateral to and outside the femoral sheath. Just inferior to the inguinal ligament, the superficial epigastric, superficial circumflex iliac, and two external pudendal arteries arise from the femoral artery. Within the femoral triangle, the deep femoral artery arises and descends posteriorly to the femoral vessels and the adductor longus muscle. The lateral and medial circumflex arteries usually arise from the deep femoral artery, as do muscular branches and several perforating branches, to supply the posterior thigh. As the femoral artery descends toward the apex of the femoral triangle, it enters the adductor canal and becomes the popliteal artery, and it assumes a position posterior to the femur. It descends inferiorly through the popliteal fossa, giving rise to five genicular arteries to the knee, and terminates by dividing into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries near the lower border of the popliteus muscle.</p>
                <p>The anterior tibial artery pierces the interosseous membrane from which it descends through the anterior compartment, supplying structures in this compartment, and terminates anterior to the ankle by becoming the dorsal artery of the foot. The dorsal artery and its lateral tarsal branch form an arch of the dorsum of the foot and is the chief blood supply to the toes. The posterior tibial artery descends in the posterior compartment and supplies it and the lateral compartment by perforating branches in addition to its fibular branch. It passes posteriorly to the medial malleolus, enters the sole of the foot, and divides into lateral and medial plantar arteries that supply the sole of the foot. Other arteries that supply portions of the lower limb include the obturator artery, which supplies the medial compartment of the thigh. The superior and inferior gluteal and the internal pudendal arteries provide the chief blood supply to the gluteal region.</p>
                <p>The lower limb has superficial and deep systems of veins, both of which terminate in the femoral vein, which continues superiorly to the inguinal ligament as the external iliac vein. The deep system of veins usually consists of paired venae comitantes, which accompany the arteries for which they are named. Thus anterior and posterior tibial veins are formed from the dorsum and sole of the foot. Fibular veins arise in the posterior compartment and drain blood to the posterior tibial veins, which ascend and are joined by the anterior tibial veins to form the popliteal vein. The popliteal vein becomes the femoral vein as it traverses the adductor canal, receives the deep femoral vein in the femoral sheath, and enters the abdomen beneath the inguinal canal to become the external iliac vein. A deep vein of the thigh accompanies its artery and drains into the femoral. The superficial system of veins is composed of the small and great saphenous veins and are found in the superficial fascia of the limb. The small saphenous is formed posterior to the lateral malleolus and ascends in the middle of the calf to terminate in the popliteal vein in the popliteal fossa. The great saphenous is formed from the dorsal venous arch of the foot anterior to the medial malleolus. It ascends along the medial aspect of the leg and thigh. It pierces the saphenous opening in the fascia lata (deep fascia of the thigh) to empty into the femoral vein within the femoral sheath. Numerous communications exist between the two saphenous veins. Of greater clinical importance, communications between the superficial and deep systems exist as perforating branches, whose valves are arranged to allow venous flow from superficial to deep, but not in the opposite direction. This important shunt allows muscular contraction to produce venous return against the effects of gravity.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 42-year-old obese diabetic woman complains of soreness of the left leg. She had gallbladder surgery 2 weeks previously. Her left calf is tender but without erythema. She is afebrile.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Venous thrombosis, or pathological blood clots within a vein, is a common cause of morbidity and mortality. Virchow triad of venous stasis, hypercoagulability, and vessel wall damage comprises notable risk factors. This patient has several risk factors for DVT. She is obese, diabetic, and has been inactive due to postoperative bed rest, with the latter producing venous stasis. Although gynecological and orthopedic surgeries especially predispose to DVT, any surgery increases the risk. Prevention of DVT includes using lower limb compression devices during and after surgery. These devices intermittently “squeeze” the legs, thereby simulating the muscular contraction of physical activity. Anticoagulant therapy, such as small-dose heparin, is also sometimes given before surgery and for 1–2 days postoperatively. If DVT is confirmed with ultrasound or radiologically with venous contrast (venogram), anticoagulation therapy is important to decrease the risk of embolization of the thrombosis, which can travel directly to the lungs to produce potentially fatal pulmonary embolism.</p>

                    <li><strong>Avulsion:</strong> Violent separation or tearing away.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Movements of the foot at the ankle occur at two joints: the ankle joint proper or talocrural joint, which is formed by the distal ends or malleoli of the fibula and tibia, and the trochlea of the talus bone. A mortise-shaped joint is formed at which the hinged movements of dorsi- and plantarflexion occur. The ankle joint is more stable in dorsiflexion because the anterior aspect of the trochlea is tightly wedged between the lateral and medial malleoli. The movements of inversion and eversion of the foot occur primarily at the subtalar joint (between the talus and calcaneus bones), but also at the transverse tarsal joint with articulation of the talus and calcaneus bones with the navicular and cuboid bones.</p>
                <p>The capsule of the ankle joint is thin anteriorly and posteriorly, but ligaments reinforce the capsule laterally and medially to provide much of the stability. A relatively weak lateral ligament is formed by three individual ligaments, all of which attach to the lateral malleolus of the fibula: anterior and posterior talofibular ligaments and calcaneofibular ligaments. The lateral ligament limits excessive inversion. The medial (deltoid) ligament is a very strong ligament composed of four individual ligaments that attach to the tibia: tibionavicular, anterior and posterior tibiotalar, and tibiocalcaneal ligaments. The medial ligament limits eversion. The muscles that produce dorsiflexion at the ankle are located in the anterior compartment of the leg, whereas the muscles that cause plantar flexion and eversion are located in the posterior and lateral compartments, respectively.</p>

Running or quick-start athletic activity, such as described in this case, may lead to strain or rupture of the tendon. The snap heard by this patient is fairly common in calcaneal tendon avulsion. The mass noted in the left calf is due to foreshortening of the triceps surae. Compared with the opposite side, the affected foot will have greater range of motion in dorsiflexion and loss of plantar flexion. Treatment is usually surgical repair of the tendon. Due to the limited blood supply to this tendon, a long immobilization is typically required. Postoperative physical therapy to prevent tendon contracture is critical.</p>

                <h3>11.1 Approach to the Mediastinum</h3>
                <p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Describe the divisions of the mediastinum and the contents of each.</li>
                    <li>Describe the lymphatic drainage of the thoracic organs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Superior vena cava syndrome:</strong> Engorgement of the vessels of the head, neck, and upper limbs accompanied by cough and respiratory difficulty due to compression of the SVC or its main tributaries by a benign or malignant mass.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bronchogenic carcinoma:</strong> A malignant tumor arising from the mucosal epithelium of the large bronchi.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mediastinum:</strong> The central region of the thorax between the two pleural cavities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The mediastinum is the central portion of the thoracic cavity, and it lies between the two pulmonary cavities. It is bounded laterally by the mediastinal pleura. It contains all the thoracic viscera except the two lungs. Superior and inferior divisions are described, with the latter further divided into anterior, middle, and posterior divisions.</p>
                <p>The superior mediastinum extends from the superior thoracic aperture bounded by the superior border of the manubrium, first rib, and T1 vertebral body. The inferior boundary is a horizontal line from the sternal angle posterior to the intervertebral disc between T4 and T5. The superior mediastinum contains the following structures, from anterior to posterior: adipose tissue with remnants of the thymus gland, right and left brachiocephalic vein, SVC, aorta with its brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid and left subclavian arterial branches, trachea, esophagus, and thoracic duct. Related to these structures are the phrenic, vagus, left recurrent laryngeal and cardiac nerves, and anterior mediastinal lymph node group.</p>
                <p>The inferior mediastinum is bounded anteriorly by the sternum, posteriorly by vertebral bodies T5 through T12, and the diaphragm inferiorly. The anterior mediastinum portion lies between the sternum and the pericardial sac and contains small branches of the internal thoracic artery and a few nodes of the parasternal lymph node group. The thymus gland is present during childhood. The middle mediastinum contains the pericardial sac with the heart, terminations of the SVC, inferior vena cava (IVC), and pulmonary veins, the ascending aorta, the pulmonary trunk and its bifurcations into the right and left pulmonary arteries, lung roots, phrenic nerve, and bronchial lymph nodes. The posterior mediastinum lies between the pericardial sac and vertebral bodies T5 through T12. It contains the esophagus, descending thoracic aorta and right intercostals and esophageal arteries, azygous venous system, thoracic duct, vagus and splanchnic nerves, and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes.</p>
                <p>The body’s main lymphatic vessel, the thoracic duct, originates in the abdomen at the level of L1 as a highly variable dilation called the cisterna chyli. It enters the posterior mediastinum through the aortic hiatus and lies on the right anterior surface of the thoracic vertebral bodies, posterior to the esophagus between the azygous venous system and the thoracic aorta. By the level of the sternal angle, the duct completes a shift to the left side, traverses the superior mediastinum, and terminates by emptying into the venous system near the junction of the left internal jugular and subclavian veins. The thoracic duct receives lymph drainage from the lower limbs, abdomen and left hemithorax, upper limb, and head and neck. A small right lymphatic duct receives lymph drainage from the right hemithorax, upper limb, and head and neck. The thoracic and right lymphatic ducts are described as receiving lymph from jugular, subclavian, and bronchomediastinal trunks, although these trunks may variably unite or empty into veins independently.</p>
                <p>Lymph node groups that drain lymph from the thoracic wall include the parasternal, intercostals, and several diaphragmatic groups. Lymph nodes that drain thoracic viscera include anterior mediastinal nodes in the anterior region of the superior mediastinum and those located on the anterior surfaces of the brachiocephalic veins, SVC, and the aortic arch and its branches. These nodes receive lymph from the thymus, inferior part of the thyroid gland, heart, pericardium, mediastinal pleura, lung hilum, and parasternal and diaphragmatic nodes. Vessels from the anterior mediastinal help form the right and left bronchomediastinal trunks. Posterior mediastinal nodes lie along the esophagus and thoracic aorta and drain lymph from the esophagus, pericardium, diaphragm, and superior surface of the liver. The vessels from this group empty into the thoracic duct or tracheobronchial nodes.</p>
                <p>The largest number of visceral nodes are associated with the lungs and airways. The lungs have superficial and deep lymphatic plexuses that drain into the bronchopulmonary (hilar) lymph node. The deep plexuses, however, first drain through pulmonary nodes along the bronchi within the lung, from which the lymph passes to the bronchopulmonary nodes. Lymph then drains to inferior and superior tracheobronchial nodes (below and above the tracheal bifurcation) and tracheal nodes located along the sides of the trachea. The tracheobronchial nodes on the right side are closely related to the SVC and receive lymph from the right lung and the inferior part of the left lung. Vessels from these node groups form the right and left bronchomediastinal trunks.</p>

                <h3>11.2 Clinical Case: Superior Vena Cava Syndrome</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 48-year-old man complains of swelling of the neck and shortness of breath of 1-week duration. He has noticed some nasal stuffiness with hoarseness of his voice for about 3 weeks and had attributed these symptoms to an upper respiratory infection. He denies the use of alcohol but has smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 30 years. Lately, he feels as though something is pushing against his throat. On physical examination, the patient’s face appears ruddy and swollen. The jugular veins are distended.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome.</li>
                    <li><strong>Most likely cause:</strong> Bronchogenic lung cancer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical structures likely involved:</strong> SVC, trachea, and right mainstem bronchus.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 48-year-old heavy smoker has a 1-week history of neck swelling, dyspnea, and the sensation of something pushing on his throat. Three weeks ago, he developed nasal stuffiness and voice hoarseness. He has facial plethora, edema, and jugular venous distention.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> The SVC receives venous drainage from the head, neck, upper limb, and thorax. Located in the upper mediastinum, this thin-walled vessel is susceptible to pressure from external sources. The most common cause of such external compression is malignancy, usually from a right-side bronchogenic carcinoma. Such tumors can also compress the trachea, producing dyspnea, and may involve the recurrent laryngeal nerve, producing hoarseness, as in this patient. The stellate sympathetic ganglion may be compressed, leading to a Horner syndrome, the clinical triad of unilateral miosis (constricted pupil), facial anhidrosis (dryness), and ptosis (drooping eyelid). The development of SVC syndrome is often an emergency because the trachea may be obstructed, leading to respiratory compromise. The priority in treatment is directed toward the airway, with oxygen and possibly diuretic agents, and corticosteroid agents to relieve the edema. A chest radiograph, computed tomographic (CT) scan, and a tissue biopsy, in that order, would be the next diagnostic steps. Most patients who have lung cancer are treated with radiotherapy. Although patients who have SVC syndrome often respond well to the radiation treatment, the overall prognosis is nearly always poor due to the advanced extent of the cancer.</p>

                    <li><strong>Axilla:</strong> Small pyramidal space between the upper lateral chest and the medial arm, including the blood vessels, nerves, and lymph nodes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tail of Spence:</strong> A protrusion of mammary tissue into the axilla that sometimes enlarges premenstrually.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The adult female breast consists of subcutaneous, radially arranged, mammary gland tissue and fat, typically extending from ribs 2 through 6 superiorly to inferiorly and from the sternal border to the midaxillary line. The long thoracic nerve lies close to the midaxillary line. For descriptive purposes, it is divided into quadrants. Each breast is centered by the elevated nipple, which contains the openings of the lactiferous ducts and is composed of circular smooth muscle. Surrounding the nipple is pigmented skin or the areola, which contains the opening of the lubricating sebaceous glands. The radially arranged mammary gland tissue forms 15 to 20 lobes, each drained by a lactiferous duct that has a dilatation called the lactiferous sinus just before its opening onto the nipple. The lobes are irregularly separated by incomplete dense connective tissue septae that attach to the dermis of the overlying skin. These septae, called the suspensory ligaments (of Cooper), are especially well developed in the superior half of the breast. A loose connective tissue layer, the retromammary space, separates the breast components and the pectoral fascia, allowing for some movement. The breast overlies the pectoralis major and the anterior portion of the serratus anterior muscles. A portion of breast tissue typically extends into the axilla as the axillary tail (of Spence).</p>
                <p>The breast is supplied by branches of the internal thoracic, lateral thoracic, and anterior and posterior intercostal arteries. The breast is innervated by anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of intercostal nerves.</p>
                <p>Lymphatic drainage of the breast begins as a subareolar plexus. The majority of lymph drained from the breast (usually quantified at 75%) drains to the axillary lymph nodes. The axillary node group is often described as a pyramid, like the axilla, and is typically subdivided into five subgroups: pectoral (anterior), lateral (humeral), posterior (subscapular), central (medial), and apical. Lymph from the axillary nodes typically drains into the inferior deep cervical lymph nodes. However, lymph from the axillary node group may drain into other nodes such as the interpectoral and deltopectoral nodes. This is especially true in instances of metastasis because “normal” paths become blocked by the malignancy and alternate routes must be established. The pectoral, humeral, and subscapular nodes are level 1 nodes, whereas the central and apical nodes are level 2 and 3 nodes, respectively.</p>
                <p>The medial quadrants of the breast will have lymph drain into the parasternal lymph nodes along the internal thoracic vessels. Some lymph from the inferior quadrants may drain to inferior phrenic nodes.</p>

                <h3>12.2 Clinical Case: Breast Cancer</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 60-year-old woman is noted to have a 2-cm mass in the left breast. The patient’s physician recommends that a core needle biopsy be performed. Tissue analysis by the pathologist under the microscope reveals intraductal carcinoma. The patient is advised by the surgeon to have surgery to remove the primary breast mass in addition to some lymph nodes. The patient undergoes wide excision of the breast mass and lymph node removal.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely lymph nodes affected:</strong> Axillary nodes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical structure that defines the “levels” of lymph nodes:</strong> The pectoralis minor muscle is used to define lymph node levels. Levels 1, 2, and 3 are lateral to, deep to, and medial to the pectoralis minor, respectively.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 60-year-old woman undergoes lumpectomy and lymph node dissection for a 2-cm intraductal carcinoma of the breast.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This 60-year-old woman had a palpable breast mass. Pathological examination revealed intraductal carcinoma in the core needle biopsy. Risk factors include the patient’s age, and intraductal carcinoma is the most common histological type. The most common treatment plan would be a breast-conserving procedure such as a lumpectomy (excising the malignant mass with some margins) and axillary lymph node dissection. The presence or absence of malignant cells in the axillary lymph nodes is the single most important prognostic factor for survival. Options for nodal staging include level 1 and 2 axillary node dissection versus sentinel node biopsy. The sentinel node(s) represents the node(s) to which primary lymph drainage occurs from a tumor or anatomical site. It is identified by injection of radiotracers and a blue dye at the primary tumor site. Biopsy of the sentinel node(s) results in a smaller incision and decreased trauma to the axilla. However, if the sentinel node(s) is positive for metastatic disease, a complete level 1 and 2 axillary dissection should be performed. Other physical signs of breast cancer, which this patient did not have, include skin dimpling or retraction, which is formed by the underlying cancer adherent to the fibrous septa of the breast, or the thickened red appearance of peau d’orange, which is caused by the malignant cells proliferating within the lymphatics underlying the skin. A red warm breast in a non–breast-feeding woman can also represent inflammatory breast cancer due to malignancy within the lymphatic channels of the skin.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Murmurs:</strong> Soft or harsh abnormal heart sounds, often caused by turbulent blood flow, and described in relation to the phase of the cardiac cycle in which they are heard.</li>
                    <li><strong>Atrial fibrillation:</strong> Rapid, uncoordinated muscular twitching of the atrial wall.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tachycardia:</strong> A heart rate of at least 100 beats/min.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The conduction system of the heart is composed of specially modified cardiac muscle cells. It initiates and rapidly conducts cardiac impulses throughout the heart to produce cardiac muscle contraction. The system ensures the simultaneous contraction of both atria, followed by a similar coordinated contraction of both ventricles.</p>
                <p>The SA node, composed of these modified cardiac muscle cells, lies within the atrial wall on the right side of its junction with the SVC. This can be located at the superior end of the external landmark, the sulcus terminalis. The SA node spontaneously depolarizes to initiate the cardiac conduction impulse and thus is often referred to as the heart’s pacemaker. The impulse generated by the SA node spreads through the atrial wall to converge on the AV node and produces simultaneous atrial contraction. Anterior, middle, and posterior internodal pathways of very rapid conduction are described.</p>
                <p>The AV node is a somewhat smaller mass of modified cardiac muscle cells located in the interatrial septum, just superior to the opening of the coronary sinus. The AV bundle (of His) arises from this node and lies within the membranous portion of the interventricular septum. It courses toward the apex of the heart, and at the upper portion of the muscular portion of this septum, it divides into right and left bundle branches. The bundle branches lie on their respective sides of the septum just beneath the endocardium. The bundles then divide to form a subendocardial plexus of Purkinje fibers. The right bundle is described as supplying the interventricular septum, the anterior papillary muscle (reached by the septomarginal or moderator band), and the wall of the right ventricle. The left bundle supplies the interventricular septum, anterior and posterior papillary muscles, and the wall of the left ventricle.</p>
                <p>The SA node or pacemaker typically will depolarize at a rate of approximately 70 times per minute. This rate is referred to as a sinus rhythm. The SA node is innervated by fibers of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Stimulation of the SA node by sympathetic nerve impulses increases the rate of depolarization of the SA node, and stimulation by parasympathetic fibers decreases this rate.</p>
                <p>The outflow from the two atria and the two ventricles is guarded by the AV and the semilunar valves, respectively. The leaflets of these cardiac valves and the myocardial muscle fibers are attached to the fibrous cardiac skeleton. This structure consists of four fibrous rings to which the leaflets attach, the right and left fibrous trigone, and the membranous portion of the interventricular septum. The right AV or tricuspid valve between the right atrium and right ventricle consists of anterior, posterior, and septal leaflets or cusps. Tendinous cords attach to the margins of adjacent valve cusps and prevent separation and inversion (prolapse) of the leaflets into the atrium during ventricular contraction. The proximal attachment of the tendinous cords is to conical projections of cardiac muscle called papillary muscles; there are three papillary muscles, named anterior, posterior, and septal, like the cusps. The tendinous cords of the anterior papillary muscle attach to the anterior and posterior cusps. Those of the posterior papillary muscle attach to the posterior and septal cusps, and the cords of the septal papillary muscle attach to the septal and anterior cusps.</p>
                <p>The left AV or bicuspid (mitral) valve between the left atrium and ventricle consists of anterior and posterior cusps. The anterior and posterior papillary muscles, although larger due to the increased pressure demands, have their tendinous cords attached to adjacent cusps and function in a manner similarly described for the tricuspid valve.</p>
                <p>The outflow from the right and left ventricles is guarded by the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves, respectively. Both semilunar valves are similar in their structure, being circular in shape and consisting of three cup-like cusps, with the opening to these cups directed superiorly. The space formed is called the pulmonary or aortic sinus and is named for the cusp that creates it. As blood is ejected from the ventricles, the cusps lie close to the pulmonary or aortic wall. At the end of contraction, the elasticity of the vessel walls results in backflow of blood that fills the sinuses, resulting in apposition of the three cusps and closure of the valves. The cusps of the pulmonary semilunar valve are the anterior, right, and left cusps, and the aortic valve has right, left, and posterior cusps. The right and left coronary arteries arise from the aorta at the right and left aortic sinuses respectively.</p>

                <h3>13.2 Clinical Case: Atrial Fibrillation/Mitral Stenosis</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 35-year-old Hispanic woman comes to your office tired and complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue. Her history is unremarkable except for a vague history of fever and joint pain as a child in Mexico. She notes some recent fatigue and difficulty sleeping that she attributes to job stress. On examination, her heart rate is 120 beats/min, and the rhythm has no discernible pattern (irregularly irregular). Auscultation of the heart indicates a systolic murmur (during left ventricular ejection of blood) that is harsh in character.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Atrial fibrillation due to left atrial enlargement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Underlying etiology:</strong> Mitral stenosis due to rheumatic heart disease.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 35-year-old Hispanic woman complains of fatigue. She had fever and joint pain as a child in Mexico. On examination, her heart rate is 120 beats/min and irregularly irregular. Cardiac examination shows a harsh systolic murmur.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This 35-year-old woman most likely has atrial fibrillation with tachycardia that is irregularly irregular. Instead of the electrical impulse originating from the sinoatrial (SA) node of the right atrium and depolarizing both atria in a regular, orderly manner, this patient’s atria have constant electrical stimulation, leading to almost continual atrial contraction that visually resembles a “bag of worms.” The irregular character of the pulse is the result of inconsistent transmission of the electrical impulse to and through the atrioventricular (AV) node and then onto the two ventricles. One common cause of atrial fibrillation is left atrial enlargement. In this patient, the history of childhood fever and joint pain likely is the result of streptococcally caused rheumatic fever. If untreated, the microorganism can cause inflammation of the mitral valve, leading to mitral stenosis. Over the course of years, the mitral stenosis is likely to worsen, leading to atrial enlargement, fibrillation, and pulmonary edema with intolerance to physical exertion. Treatment in this patient would focus on decreasing her heart rate with an agent that acts on the AV node such as digoxin. Oxygen and diuretics would relieve her pulmonary symptoms. An ultimate goal will be the conversion of her cardiac contractions to a normal sinus rhythm. Anticoagulation is often warranted in the face of long-term atrial fibrillation because of the likelihood of intracardiac thrombus and the possibility of emboli after conversion to sinus rhythm, called the “atrial stunning” effect. Surgical correction of the mitral stenosis is also important.</p>

The pulmonary arteries are the most superior vessels in the hilum of each lung, and the branch to the superior lobe of each lung typically arises outside the lung hilum. Each artery courses through the lung tissue adjacent to bronchial and bronchiolar airway structures, where they branch out and are named for these airway structures. Thus each artery will divide into lobar and then segmental branches to the lung lobes and their bronchopulmonary segments, respectively. Further branching of bronchioles and the adjacent arteries occur down to the level of the terminal bronchiole, which supplies a lobule, the smallest anatomical unit of lung tissue.</p>
                <p>As the small pulmonary artery branches reach the respiratory bronchioles, they form the extensive capillary network around and between the alveoli. The thin capillary endothelium, basal lamina, and type I pneumocytes form the blood-gas barrier through which gaseous exchange occurs.</p>
                <p>Oxygenated blood drains from the capillary bed to pulmonary veins within the thin connective tissue septae between lobules. In this location, they receive blood from adjacent lobules. As the pulmonary veins unite to form increasingly larger veins, they remain separated from the pulmonary artery and airway structures, being found at the periphery of lung tissue subdivisions such as the bronchopulmonary segments and lobes. These larger veins will drain adjacent segments or lobes. Eventually, two pulmonary veins exit the hilum of each lung anteriorly and inferiorly to the entering pulmonary arteries. Thus four pulmonary veins drain oxygenated blood into the left atrium.</p>
                <p>The bronchi, bronchioles, and related structures, the connective tissue stroma and the visceral pleura, receive their blood supply from bronchial arteries. These are typically branches of the thoracic aorta but may arise from intercostal arteries. Anastomoses between the pulmonary and bronchial arteries occur within the bronchial walls and the visceral pleura. Bronchial veins from the right and left lungs typically drain to the azygous and accessory hemiazygous veins, respectively, but carry only small amounts of blood. The pulmonary vein carries most of the blood supplied by the bronchial arteries.</p>

                <h3>14.2 Clinical Case: Pulmonary Embolism</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 65-year-old woman underwent surgery to remove her uterus (total abdominal hysterectomy) due to uterine cancer 2 days previously. She was doing well until today, when she developed shortness of breath, and she describes a sharp pain in the right side of her chest at inspiration. On physical examination, her respiratory rate is 28 breaths/min and a heart rate of 110 beats/min. Auscultation of the lungs demonstrates no wheezing or crackles. She appears anxious.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Pulmonary embolism.</li>
                    <li><strong>Most likely location of the primary disease:</strong> Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the pelvis or lower limb.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Two days ago, a 65-year-old woman underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy due to endometrial cancer. She developed acute onset dyspnea with pleuritic chest pain. She has tachypnea and tachycardia and appears anxious. Rales (crackles) are not present by pulmonary examination.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This woman has multiple risk factors for DVT or blood clot formation within the large veins. These factors include the patient’s age, likely minimal physical exercise, and bed rest after a major operative gynecological procedure for a cancerous lesion. Postoperative orthopedic patients are similarly at risk. Deep vein thrombi are typically asymptomatic but may cause lower limb swelling and pain. When pelvic or lower limb veins are involved, clot material can break free (embolize) and travel through the IVC to and through the right side of the heart, whence they are pumped to the lungs, where they will lodge in branches of the pulmonary arteries. These emboli effectively block blood flow beyond this point and prevent this unoxygenated blood from reaching the alveoli, where it is to be oxygenated. The size and number of emboli produced will determine the amount of lung tissue that will be infarcted due to lack of oxygen. The most common symptom of pulmonary embolism is dyspnea, and patients are often anxious, with tachycardia and pleuritic chest pain at inspiration. The next step would be an arterial blood-gas study to assess oxygen status. A chest radiograph and ventilation-perfusion scan are performed to directly determine whether an embolus is present. If present, intravenous anticoagulants such as heparin are beneficial. Large or untreated emboli can cause death. One particularly devastating type is called the saddle embolus. This type lodges in the pulmonary trunk at the bifurcation of the right and left pulmonary arteries, thus blocking blood flow to both lungs, leading to cardiovascular collapse and death.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:</strong> General term applied to permanent or temporary diseases that cause narrowing of the bronchi so as to obstruct forced expiratory flow and includes bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, among others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Emphysema:</strong> A lung condition in which the air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles are larger than normal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pneumothorax:</strong> Air or gas within the pleural cavity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chest tube:</strong> Tube inserted through the thoracic wall into the pleural cavity for the purpose of draining air or fluid from that cavity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The skeletal components of the thoracic wall are the thoracic vertebra, the attached 12 pairs of ribs and the sternum. The interval between the ribs is closed by three layers of muscles, the external, internal, and innermost intercostal muscles. The transverse thoracic and subcostal muscles are discontinuous thoracic wall muscles found anteriorly and posteriorly, respectively. Externally, several muscles associated with the upper limb or accessory respiratory muscles attach to the thoracic wall. These include the pectoralis major and minor, serratus anterior and posterior, scalene, and levator costarum muscles. Internally, the thoracic cavity is divided into two pulmonary cavities separated by the central mediastinum. The thoracic cavity is closed inferiorly by the diaphragm.</p>
                <p>Each of the two laterally placed pulmonary cavities contains a lung covered with visceral pleura, and each is lined with parietal pleura. The two pleura are continuous with each other at the root of the lung, where neurovascular and airway structures enter and exit the lung. The pleura is a serous membrane composed of mesothelium and a small amount of connective tissue, and it produces the lubricating pleural fluid. The parietal pleura is divided for descriptive purposes into four parts based on the structure to which it is attached. The costal, diaphragmatic, mediastinal, and cervical portions are attached, respectively, to the inner aspect of the thoracic wall, the superior surface of the diaphragm, the lateral aspect of the mediastinum, especially the pericardial sac, and the root of the neck superior to the superior thoracic aperture.</p>
                <p>Relative constant pleural lines of reflection are created as one portion of parietal pleura changes direction to attach to another structure. The sternal reflection line is created as the mediastinal pleura change direction (is reflected) onto the inner thoracic wall and become the costal pleura. In the right pulmonary cavity, this line of reflection is close to the midline from the sternal angle to the xiphoid process. On the left side, the line of reflection courses from the sternal angle to the level of the fourth rib, and then arches to the left to the sixth rib in the midclavicular line, thus creating the cardiac notch. Due to the curvature of the mediastinal surface in this region, a shallow costomediastinal recess of the pleural cavity is created. Inferiorly as the costal pleura are reflected onto the surface of the diaphragm, the costal reflection line is created. The surface landmarks for this reflection line on the right and left sides are the 8th rib at the midclavicular line (MCL), the 10th rib at the midaxillary line (MAL), and the 12th rib at the vertebral border. These landmarks also mark the inferior limits of the pleural cavity. The curved shape of the diaphragmatic pleura on the dome of the diaphragm and the vertical costal pleura form a wedge-shaped pleural cavity recess called the costodiaphragmatic recess, in which abnormal pleural cavity fluids such as blood or pus will accumulate. The lowest level of each lung at the end of expiration is the 6th rib at the MCL, the 8th rib at the MAL, and the 10th rib at the vertebral border. The cervical pleura and thus the pleural cavity extend into the root of the neck, 2 to 3 cm superior to the medial end of the clavicle.</p>
                <p>The pleural cavity between the visceral and parietal layers of pleura is a potential space in which there is a small amount of lubricating pleural fluid. This fluid wets the surface of the lungs, resulting in adherence of the lung’s visceral pleura to the costal and diaphragmatic parietal pleura by surface tension forces. As the diaphragm descends and the thoracic wall expands with inspiration, the adherent lungs also expand. The pleural cavities are completely closed spaces and are at 756 mm Hg of pressure, or at –4 mm Hg with respect to atmospheric pressure (760 mm Hg). If the visceral pleura covering the lung is ruptured or the costal parietal pleura is disrupted by trauma, air will enter the pleural cavity, causing a pneumothorax and at least equalizing pleural pressure with atmospheric pressure. This will produce at least a partial lung collapse and interfere with ventilation and gaseous exchange.</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 54-year-old man who had smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 20 years complains of the acute onset of shortness of breath, and severe chest pain with respiratory movement. On physical examination, he has a barrel chest consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There are decreased breath sounds on the right side. When the physician taps on the right chest (percussion), there is a hyperresonant (unusually hollow) sound.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Pneumothorax.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical disorder:</strong> Entry of air into the pleural space, resulting in lung collapse.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 54-year-old smoker complains of acute onset of shortness of breath and severe chest pain with breathing. He has physical findings for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a barrel chest. There are decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance to percussion on the right side.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Air is drawn into the lungs through the trachea and bronchi by the increasing negative thoracic pressure produced by the downward movement of the diaphragm. If air enters the pleural space through the thoracic wall or the surface of the lung itself, the negative pressure of the pleural space equilibrates with atmospheric pressure, and air movement ceases. The defect that allowed air to enter the pleural space acts like a valve by preventing the air from exiting the space. Pressure increases above that of atmospheric pressure, and a tension pneumothorax results, which is characterized by lung collapse, with displacement toward the mediastinum. If severe enough, the mediastinum and its contents may be displaced toward the intact lung and produce partial compression of this lung. The most serious consequence of these anatomical shifts is decreased venous return to the heart. This patient who has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is at risk for spontaneous pneumothorax by the rupture of an emphysematous bleb on the surface of the lung. Spontaneous pneumothorax may also occur from lung surface blebs in young men. The typical clinical presentation of pneumothorax is chest pain with dyspnea, decreased breath sounds, and hyperresonance on the affected side. The diagnosis is confirmed by chest radiograph. Treatment is directed toward removal of the air from the pleural space with a needle in emergent situations or by a chest tube placed in the pleural space and directed to an underwater seal.</p>

                    <li><strong>Palpitations:</strong> Pulsations of the heart perceptible by a patient that are usually irregular and increased in force.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bradycardia:</strong> Heart rate no faster than 60 beats/min.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The heart receives its arterial blood supply from the first branches of the ascending aorta, the right and left coronary arteries. The right and left artery arise from the aorta at the aortic sinuses, the pockets formed by the right and left cusps of the aortic valve, respectively. Each artery will supply portions of the atria and ventricles.</p>
                <p>The right coronary artery (RCA) arises at the right aortic sinus and courses in the coronary (AV) groove between the right atrium and ventricle. At the level of the right auricular appendage, it gives off the SA nodal branch, which ascends to the junction of the SVC with the right atrium, where the SA node is located. As it reaches the inferior margin of the heart in the coronary groove, it will usually give off a right marginal branch that supplies the right ventricle along the inferior border. The RCA then curves around the inferior margin of the heart in the coronary groove onto the inferior and posterior surfaces of the heart, passing somewhat to the left toward the junction with the posterior interventricular groove, also called the crux of the heart. At the crux, the AV nodal branch passes deep into the interatrial septum to supply the AV node. The RCA divides into a larger posterior interventricular artery, which descends in the groove or sulcus of the same name. It passes toward but typically does not reach the apex of the heart. It supplies the right and left ventricles and posterior portions of the interventricular septum. A small branch continues to the left side of the heart to supply portions of the left atrium and ventricle and will anastomose with the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery (LCA).</p>
                <p>The LCA arises from the left aortic sinus and quickly bifurcates into an anterior interventricular and circumflex arteries. The anterior interventricular or left anterior descending (LAD) artery descends toward the apex of the heart in the anterior interventricular groove, where it curves around the apex onto the diaphragmatic surface of the heart to anastomose with the posterior (descending) interventricular branch of the RCA. The anterior interventricular artery supplies the anterior portion of the right and left ventricles and anterior two-thirds of the interventricular septum and therefore is the chief blood supply to the AV and the right and left bundles of the heart’s conducting system. The other smaller branch of the LCA is the circumflex branch, which travels in the coronary groove toward the left margin of the heart, at which point it typically gives off a left marginal branch that supplies the left heart border portion of the left ventricle. The circumflex artery curves around the left heart border to anastomose with the RCA at the posterior aspects of the left atrium and ventricle. The pattern of arterial blood supply at this point is often described as a balanced blood supply because the RCA and LCA supply approximately equal amounts to the heart. In approximately 15 percent of the population, the LCA will supply a larger proportion than the RCA.</p>
                <p>The majority of venous blood will enter the right atrium through the coronary sinus, which lies in the coronary groove on the posterior surface of the heart. Its internal opening is adjacent to the opening of the IVC. Great, middle, and small cardiac veins and several smaller named veins drain into the coronary sinus. A variable number of small anterior cardiac veins drain directly into the right atrium. The smallest cardiac veins drain small amounts of blood from the myocardial capillary plexus directly into the atria and ventricles.</p>
                <p>The heart’s pericardial sac receives its arterial blood supply primarily from the pericardiacophrenic artery (a branch of the internal thoracic artery) that accompanies the phrenic nerve. Small amounts of arterial blood are also provided by branches of the musculophrenic, superior phrenic, bronchial, and esophageal arteries. Pericardiacophrenic veins drain blood to the internal thoracic or brachiocephalic veins.</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 59-year-old man complains of tight chest pressure and shortness of breath after lifting several boxes in his garage approximately 2 hours ago. He says he believes his heart is skipping beats. His medical history is significant for hypertension and cigarette smoking. On examination, his heart rate is 55 beats/min and regular, and his lungs are clear to auscultation. An electrocardiogram shows bradycardia with an increased PR interval and ST-segment elevation in multiple leads including the anterior leads, V1 and V2.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Myocardial infarction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical structures likely affected:</strong> Right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 59-year-old hypertensive male smoker has a 2-hour history of tight chest pressure, shortness of breath, and palpitations after exertion. His heart rate is 55 beats/min and regular. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows bradycardia, first-degree heart block, and ST-segment elevation in leads V1 and V2.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This patient’s 2-hour history of worsening chest pain, dyspnea, and palpitations after physical exertion is classic for a myocardial infarction. The pain of angina due to the myocardial ischemia is typically deep, visceral, and squeezing in nature, like an “elephant stepping on the chest.” It frequently radiates to the neck or left arm. This patient’s risk factors include hypertension and tobacco use. The ECG (ST-segment elevation) is highly suspicious for myocardial infarction. Leads V1 and V2 are used to evaluate the anterior portion of the heart which is supplied by the left anterior descending artery. Bradycardia and first-degree heart block (increased PR interval) indicate right coronary artery disease.</p>

                <p>The anterior abdominal wall is composed of three paired flat muscles that, in general, arise from bony structures posteriorly and whose fibrous aponeuroses form the rectus sheath and meet to form the linea alba. These muscles are from superficial to deep: the external abdominal oblique, internal abdominal oblique, and transversus abdominis. These muscles are supplied by segmental branches of the thoracic and abdominal aorta: the 10th, 11th, and 12th (subcostal) intercostal arteries and the 1st or 2nd lumbar arteries. These arteries, their companion veins, and the nerves supplying the muscles are all found in the interval between the internal abdominal oblique and the transversus abdominis muscles, known as the neurovascular plane. Superficial and deep circumflex iliac arteries arise from the femoral and external iliac arteries, respectively, course parallel to the inguinal ligament, and supply the inferior abdominal wall in the inguinal region. The superficial epigastric arteries lie in the superficial fascia between the umbilicus and the pubic bone. The internal thoracic arteries divide into two terminal branches: the superior epigastric and musculophrenic arteries.</p>
                <p>The anterior central region of the abdominal wall is formed by the paired rectus abdominis muscles, which attach to the pubic bone inferiorly and the rib cartilages superiorly, and lie just lateral to the linea alba. Each muscle is subdivided into short belly segments by typically three or more tendinous inscriptions. Each muscle is contained in a fibrous compartment, the rectus sheath, that is formed by the aponeuroses of the three flat abdominal muscles. Enclosing the superior three-fourths of each rectus muscle are anterior and posterior layers to the sheath. In this region, the aponeurosis of the internal abdominal muscle divides, and portions will pass anteriorly and posteriorly to the rectus muscle. It follows that the aponeuroses of the external oblique muscle and the transversus abdominis muscles must pass anteriorly and posteriorly to the rectus, respectively. At about the midpoint between the umbilicus and the pubic bone, the aponeuroses of all three flat abdominal muscles pass anterior to the rectus sheath; therefore, the inferior one-fourth of the rectus muscle has only an anterior rectus sheath. The inferior margin of the posterior rectus sheath can be identified in this region of transition as the arcuate line. The rectus sheath also contains the pyramidalis muscles, superior and inferior epigastric vessels, and terminations of the intercostal nerves that innervate the abdominal muscle. The superior one-fourth of the rectus muscle is supplied by the medial terminal branch of the internal thoracic artery, the superior epigastric artery. The inferior epigastric artery arises from the external iliac artery just before its exit from the abdomen to become the femoral artery. Each artery courses medially, external to the peritoneum, along the posterior surface of the rectus muscles. The superior and inferior epigastric arteries anastomose about halfway between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process.</p>

                <h3>17.2 Clinical Case: Inferior Epigastric Artery</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 31-year-old woman with one healthy child presents with a 2-year history of an inability to conceive. She states that her menstrual periods began at age 12 and occur at regular 28-day intervals. A biphasic basal body temperature chart is recorded. She denies having any sexually transmitted disease, and a hysterosalpingogram shows patent uterine tubes and a normal uterine cavity. Her husband is 34 years old and his semen analysis is normal. In the presence of several normal test results for infertility, a laparoscopic examination of the pelvic cavity is scheduled. The physician performing the procedure carefully places the trocar lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle and its sheath to avoid injury to a major artery.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Artery that is avoided:</strong> Inferior epigastric artery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical location of this artery:</strong> Posterior to the rectus abdominis within the rectus sheath.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> An infertile couple is being evaluated, and several tests for infertility have shown normal results. A laparoscopic examination of the pelvic cavity is performed to rule out the presence of endometriosis. The trocar is specifically placed lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle and its sheath to avoid a major artery.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> The presence of several normal test results indicates a need to rule out endometriosis in this infertile couple. Endometriosis is defined as ectopic endometrial tissue outside the uterus, typically adherent to the pelvic peritoneum. This tissue responds to a woman’s hormonal cycles in the same way that the lining of the uterus responds. Although the mechanism is not fully understood, endometriosis may cause infertility by inhibiting ovulation, producing adhesions, or interfering with fertilization. Laparoscopic examination of the pelvic cavity is indicated and, if possible at this time, ablation of the endometrial tissue.</p>

                <h3>18.1 Approach to the Inguinal Region</h3>
                <p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Describe the anatomy of the inguinal region.</li>
                    <li>Discern the anatomical basis for an indirect versus a direct inguinal hernial classification.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Valsalva maneuver:</strong> Increase intra-abdominal pressure by attempting to exhale with a closed glottis.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The inguinal region is the junction between the lower anterior abdominal and the upper anterior thigh. It is the site at which several structures enter and exit the abdomen and therefore is an area of potential weakness in males and females. The inguinal (Poupart) ligament is an important anatomical structure and key landmark for this region. It is the thickened, rolled underedge of the inferior portion of the external abdominal oblique aponeurosis. It extends from the anterior superior iliac spine to the pubic tubercle and fuses inferiorly with the fascia lata (deep fascia) of the anterior thigh. At the pubic tubercle, the inguinal ligament continues posterolaterally on the superior pubic ramus (pectin of the pubic bone) as the pectineal (Cooper) ligament. At the point where these two ligaments are continuous and change directions, a ligamentous reflection fills the interval, forming the lacunar (Gimbernat) ligament.</p>
                <p>The lacunar ligament forms a rigid medial margin for the femoral ring, leading to the femoral canal, the site for femoral hernias. Although the external abdominal oblique muscle and aponeurosis comprise an essentially complete musculotendinous structure (except the superficial inguinal ring), the internal abdominal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles are deficient because they originate from the iliopsoas fascia and arch medially to their tendinous (falx inguinalis) insertions on the pubic tubercle.</p>
                <p>Structures enter and exit the abdomen superior to the inguinal ligament through an oblique passage known as the inguinal canal. The canal is frequently described as a tunnel, with openings, walls, floor, and so on. The boundaries of the inguinal canal include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Anterior wall:</strong> Aponeurosis of external abdominal oblique muscle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Posterior wall:</strong> Transversalis fascia and parietal peritoneum.</li>
                    <li><strong>Floor:</strong> Inguinal ligament and lacunar ligament medially.</li>
                    <li><strong>Roof:</strong> Arching fibers of internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscle.</li>
                    <li><strong>External opening:</strong> Superficial inguinal ring: triangular opening in external oblique aponeurosis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Internal opening:</strong> Site of outpouching of transversalis fascia: covered with parietal peritoneum.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Due to the arching of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles, the posterior wall of the canal is deficient and weak, being formed only by the transversalis fascia and parietal peritoneum. However, with increased intra-abdominal pressure (as in lifting, bowel movement, etc.), these muscles contract and descend in a shutter-like fashion, thus reinforcing the posterior wall. The outpouching of the transversalis fascia to form the deep inguinal ring occurs immediately lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels. At the medial portion of the inguinal ligament on the interior of the abdominal wall, a clinically important inguinal (Hesselbach) triangle is formed by the inguinal ligament, inferior epigastric vessels, and the lateral margin of the rectus abdominis muscle and corresponds to the area where the posterior wall of the canal is deficient due to the arching of the abdominal wall muscles described above.</p>
                <p>In females, the inguinal canal is traversed by the round ligament of the uterus; in males, the spermatic cord (ductus deferens and associated vessels and nerves) passes through the canal. The ilioinguinal nerve is found in the canal in both sexes.</p>
                <p>The inguinal region and canal comprise the site for inguinal hernias. Although hernias occur in both sexes, they are far more common in males. There are two types of inguinal hernias, indirect and direct. Indirect or congenital inguinal hernias tend to occur in young males. During embryonic descent of the testes, an outpouching of parietal peritoneum, the tunica vaginalis, pushes through the lower abdominal wall, encountering first the transversalis fascia (thus forming the deep inguinal ring), slipping inferior to the transversus abdominis muscle, but catching the lower margin of the internal abdominal oblique muscle, and then pushing through the external abdominal oblique muscle (forming the superficial inguinal ring). The testes descend into the scrotum along the path created by the tunica vaginalis (and the gubernaculum). In normal development, this outpouching fuses and closes. If it does not fuse and close, a predisposing complete or partial path for the abnormal migration of an abdominal organ (usually small intestine) is established. The loop of small intestine would pass through the deep inguinal ring, inguinal canal, and possibly through the superficial ring into the scrotum. By definition, indirect inguinal hernias leave the abdominal cavity lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels (through the deep inguinal ring).</p>
                <p>Direct inguinal hernias are also called acquired inguinal hernias because they are seen in older males and are related to strenuous activity that increases intra-abdominal pressure. It is believed that with aging there is loss of tone in the abdominal musculature and the shutter-like actions described above for the internal abdominal oblique and transversus abdominis are diminished or lost. This predisposes abdominal organs to push directly anterior through the parietal peritoneum and transversalis fascia in the inguinal triangle area and into the posterior wall of the canal. Due to the larger herniation, these hernias tend not to enter the scrotum. Direct inguinal hernias by definition leave the abdomen medial to the inferior epigastric vessels because these vessels form the lateral boundary of the triangle.</p>

                <h3>18.2 Clinical Case: Inguinal Hernia</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 44-year-old man complains of discomfort in his right upper thigh over the past 6 months. He works in the garden department of a home improvement center. On examination, there is tenderness at the right inguinal area. When the patient performs a Valsalva maneuver (bearing down to increase intra-abdominal pressure), a bulge appears superior to the inguinal crease near the pubic bone.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Inguinal hernia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Associated anatomical defect:</strong> Protrusion of an abdominal organ into the inguinal canal.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 44-year-old man who works in the garden department of a home improvement center has a 6-month history of right groin pain. There is inguinal tenderness and a bulge with the performance of a Valsalva maneuver.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> A hernia is defined as an abnormal protrusion of a structure through tissues that normally contain it. Inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia, occurring in men and women, but occur much more frequently in men. This patient’s age and his occupation, which requires frequent lifting activity, suggest a direct or acquired inguinal hernia. Loss of tone in the musculature in the inguinal region predisposes to progressive stretching of the parietal peritoneum into the posterior inguinal canal with repeated increased intra-abdominal pressure associated with the lifting activity. If the patient were a young man or child, an indirect or congenital inguinal hernia would be a more likely diagnosis. With an indirect hernia, the parietal peritoneum at the deep inguinal ring exists as a finger-like protrusion into the inguinal canal. This is the result of faulty closure of the embryonic outpouching of peritoneum into the scrotum, called the processus vaginalis. Indirect inguinal hernias enter the deep inguinal ring, stretch peritoneal tissue with repeated increases in intra-abdominal pressure, traverse the length of the inguinal canal, and enter the scrotum. Surgical repair of the tissue defect is indicated to prevent incarceration, infarction, and necrosis of the herniated tissue, typically a loop of small intestine.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cholecystitis:</strong> Inflammation of the gallbladder often associated with gallstones.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The gallbladder is an inverted, pear-shaped, fibromuscular sac for the temporary storage and intermittent release of bile, produced in the liver. Its surface position can be approximated at the intersection of the right margin of the rectus sheath (linea semilunaris) and the right costal margin. Its anterior surface is fused to the liver between the right and quadrate lobes, and its fundus, lateral, and posterior surfaces are covered with visceral peritoneum. It is anatomically divided into fundus, body, and a neck, which is continuous with the cystic duct. The mucosa of the neck and cystic duct are spiral fold which acts as a valve to keep the lumen of the duct and neck open to receive bile. The gallbladder and cystic duct are supplied by the cystic artery, typically a branch of the right hepatic artery.</p>
                <p>The biliary duct system begins as bile canaliculi between hepatocytes within the liver. The canaliculi empty into microscopic interlobular bile ducts, which unite to form larger and larger ducts, eventually forming segmental and lobar ducts draining anatomical subdivisions of the liver of the same name. Ultimately, right and left hepatic ducts emerge from the liver’s porta hepatis, and unite to form the common hepatic duct within the hepatoduodenal ligament (a portion of the lesser omentum). The cystic duct joins the common hepatic duct from the right to form the common bile duct. The common bile duct passes inferior within the hepatoduodenal ligament, to then pass posterior to the first part of the duodenum. It turns slightly to the right on or within the posterior surface of the pancreas. As it approaches the posteromedial wall of the duodenum, it is typically joined by the main pancreatic duct to form the hepatopancreatic ampulla, which opens on the major duodenal papilla.</p>
                <p>At the porta hepatis, the right and left hepatic ducts are the most anterior structures. The hepatic arteries (right and left) lie posterior to the hepatic ducts, and the branches of the portal vein lie most posterior. The common hepatic duct (on the left), the cystic duct (on the right) and the inferior border of the liver (superior) form the cystohepatic triangle of Calot, which contains the right hepatic artery and its cystic artery branch.</p>
                <p>Within the hepatoduodenal ligament, the anterior boundary of the epiploic foramen (of Winslow), the common bile duct lies to the right, the common hepatic artery lies to the left, and the portal vein lies posterior and between the duct and the artery.</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 42-year-old woman is seen by her primary care physician complaining of intermittent colicky pain. She describes the pain as being right upper quadrant (RUQ), starting shortly after eating a meal, and lasting about 30 minutes. During these episodes, she says she feels bloated and nauseated. The patient also states that over the past 2 days, her stools have become very light in color, like the color of sand, and her skin has become yellow.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Gallstones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical basis for condition:</strong> Bile duct obstruction, probably by gallstones.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 42-year-old woman presents with intermittent colicky RUQ abdominal pain shortly after eating, that lasts for about 30 minutes. It is associated with bloating, nausea, and a 2-day history of acholic stools and icterus.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This middle-aged woman has the typical symptoms of biliary colic, which is intermittent crampy abdominal pain in the epigastric region of the RUQ, sometimes radiating to the right shoulder. These symptoms typically appear after meals, particularly fatty meals. The more concerning signs are the light-colored stools (acholic) and jaundice (icterus). Gallstones (cholelithiasis) are precipitated bile salts in the gallbladder, which may produce inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis). Stones can pass into the cystic duct and into the common bile duct. Since the common bile duct is formed by the union of the cystic and common hepatic ducts, obstruction of the common bile duct prevents bilirubin produced in the liver from reaching the small intestines. The stools thus are lacking this pigment. As a secondary result of the obstruction, serum bilirubin is elevated, precipitated in the skin, resulting in the yellow tint. Ultrasound can often make the initial diagnosis. Removal of a common bile duct stone can be performed by upper GI endoscopy through the ampulla of Vater or surgically.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>The abdominal gastrointestinal viscera are supplied by the three major unpaired branches of the abdominal aorta: celiac artery (trunk), superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). These three arteries supply organs embryologically derived from the foregut, midgut, and hindgut, respectively. The duodenum proximal to the entrance of the common bile duct receives its blood supply from the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery, a branch of the gastroduodenal artery from the celiac artery. The remainder of the small intestines is supplied by the SMA. The SMA arises from the abdominal aorta at the level of the lower border of L1, posterior to the neck of the pancreas. As it emerges from behind the pancreas, it passes anterior to the uncinate process of the pancreas and the third part of the duodenum and enters the root of the mesentery. As it enters the mesenteric root, it gives off its inferior pancreaticoduodenal and middle colic arteries, the latter to the transverse colon within its mesentery, the transverse mesocolon. As the SMA descends toward the ileocolic junction, 15 to 18 intestinal branches arise, which pass between the layers of the mesentery, and are united by increasingly complex anatomical arcades. The arcades closest to the mesenteric attachment to the jejunum and ileum give off increasingly shorter straight arteries (vasa recta) that enter the small intestines. Other branches of the SMA include the right colic to the ascending colon and the ileocolic to the cecum, appendix, and ascending colon.</p>

                <h3>20.2 Clinical Case: Small Bowel Mesenteric Angina</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 62-year-old woman complains of the sudden onset of severe midabdominal pain that has been increasing over the past 3 hours. She has a history of myocardial ischemia and peripheral vascular disease. The patient indicates she has had nausea and vomiting. On examination, she is writhing in pain. Her abdomen has normal bowel sounds and minimal tenderness. A small amount of blood is present in the stool specimen. The electrolytes show a low bicarbonate level at 15 mEq/L, and the serum lactate level is high, which are indicative of tissue receiving insufficient oxygenation leading to tissue injury. A surgeon who is concerned about intestinal ischemia has been called to evaluate the patient.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Mesenteric ischemia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical structures likely involved:</strong> Arteries that supply the small bowel, probably branches of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 62-year-old woman with widespread atherosclerotic vascular disease complains of a 3-hour history of severe midabdominal pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Although writhing in pain, bowel sounds are normal, and there is minimal tenderness. Blood is present in the stool, and electrolytes show low levels of bicarbonate at 15 mEq/L and high levels of lactate; these findings are suspected as a result of lack of oxygen to intestinal tissue, leading to anaerobic metabolism. The surgeon is concerned about ischemia.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This elderly woman complains of sudden onset of severe midabdominal pain that is out of proportion to the physical findings. She has a history of widespread atherosclerotic vascular disease affecting the coronary arteries and peripheral vasculature. The presence of blood in the stool suggests bowel injury, and the low level of serum bicarbonate is consistent with a metabolic acidemia. Bowel ischemia or necrosis is causative. Arterial occlusion may occur from rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque or embolization from another clot. This patient’s midabdominal symptoms suggest arteriography of the SMA, and the celiac artery might be diagnostic. Upon confirmation, surgical embolectomy is usually helpful. The mortality rate is high in such patients. Although the first part of the duodenum is supplied by the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery, which receives its blood from the celiac artery, the remainder of the small intestines is supplied by branches of the SMA.</p>

                <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Appendicitis:</strong> Inflammation of the appendix that is often associated with a fecalith, a small piece of stool that occludes the proximal appendix.</li>
                    <li><strong>Referred pain:</strong> Pain that originates from a deep structure that is perceived at the surface of the body often at a different location.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The typical position of the appendix can be approximated at a point (McBurney) one-third of the way along a line drawn from the right anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus. The appendix is an elongated diverticulum that arises from the cecum inferior to the ileocecal junction. The three longitudinal smooth muscle bands characteristic of the cecum and colon, the teniae coli, can be traced inferiorly to the posteromedial origin of the appendix from the cecum. The appendix lies in the margin of a small triangular mesentery, the mesoappendix, within which the appendicular artery (a branch of the ileocolic artery) is also found. The posterior surface of the cecum is often covered with visceral peritoneum, creating a retrocecal recess. In close to 66 percent of individuals, the appendix is retrocecal in position and is found in this recess. In almost 33 percent of individuals, the appendix is free and extends inferiorly toward or over the pelvic brim. The cecum and the appendix can lie at higher or lower positions relative to McBurney point due to faulty embryonic gut rotation.</p>
                <p>The large intestines are characterized by the presence of teniae coli, haustra, omental appendices, and their large diameter. The cecum is the pouch-like first part of the large intestines into which the ileum opens and the appendix arises. It is continuous superiorly with the ascending colon. The ascending colon is the shortest segment of colon, is retroperitoneal (lacks a mesentery), is continuous with the transverse colon at the right colic (hepatic) flexure, and is supplied by the ileocolic and right colic branches of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The transverse colon is the longest segment of colon, begins at the right colic flexure, and is continuous with the descending colon at the more superiorly positioned left colic (splenic) flexure. It is intraperitoneal, being suspended by its mesentery, the transverse mesocolon. The middle colic artery branch of the SMA lies within the mesentery. The descending colon is retroperitoneal, continuous with the sigmoid colon near the left iliac crest, and is supplied by the left colic artery, a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The sigmoid colon is suspended by its mesentery, the sigmoid mesocolon, in which its blood supply, the several sigmoidal arteries, are found. The sigmoid colon ends at the rectosigmoid junction, which lies at the S3 vertebral level. The arteries that supply the colon are connected by continuous arterial anastomoses called the marginal arteries.</p>
                <p>The initial vague, poorly localized pain of appendicitis results from the stretching of the visceral peritoneum secondary to the inflammation of the organ. The visceral afferent nerve fibers from the appendix have their cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia and enter the spinal cord at levels T8 through T10. Sensory fibers from the umbilicus enter the spinal cord at T10. The brain misinterprets (refers) the pain from the appendix as arising from the umbilical and nearby abdominal wall. This is called referred pain. As the inflammatory process progresses, adjacent parietal peritoneum is typically irritated, and the pain shifts to the actual location of the appendix in the RLQ. The parietal peritoneum is innervated by somatic sensory nerve fibers and, when irritated, produces sharp, well-localized pain sensation. If the appendix is retrocecal, the parietal peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall is irritated, resulting in side or flank tenderness.</p>
                <p>Pain originating from foregut-derived organs and supplied by the celiac artery is generally perceived in the epigastric region. Pain from midgut-derived organs supplied by the SMA is perceived in the periumbilical region, and pain in the infraumbilical region arises from hindgut organs (IMA).</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>An 18-year-old male college student complains of 12-hour abdominal pain that began around his umbilicus but then shifted to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) and right side. He indicates that he has been nauseous over the past several hours. His temperature is 99.4°F. On physical examination, there is mild abdominal tenderness, particularly in the RLQ, but also on the right side. The laboratory analysis of the urine is normal.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Appendicitis, possibly retrocecal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cause of shift in location of pain:</strong> Pain initially irritates the visceral peritoneum, is referred to the periumbilical area, and then localized to RLQ as the appendicitis worsens and inflames the parietal peritoneum.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> An 18-year-old man complains of 12-hour abdominal pain that is initially periumbilical and then migrates to the RLQ. He has some nausea and a low-grade fever. The abdomen is tender in the RLQ and right lateral region. The urinalysis is normal.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This college student’s complaints are suspicious for appendicitis. The appendix is a small diverticulum that arises from the cecum and is typically free in the peritoneal cavity. Not infrequently, however, it is retrocecal in location and causes right-side or flank tenderness and very few peritoneal signs. Initially, the abdominal pain is vaguely and generally located to the periumbilical region, but with time, it becomes sharper and precisely located to the RLQ. Nausea is common but presents after the onset of pain. Men and women are equally affected by appendicitis, but the diagnosis is usually more straightforward in men. A serum leukocyte count may be helpful. Ultimately, the suspicion is a clinical one, and diagnostic laparoscopy is undertaken to visualize the appendix. If appendicitis is confirmed, surgery is indicated.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pancreatitis:</strong> Inflammation of the pancreas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Retroperitoneal:</strong> Posterior or external to the peritoneal cavity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Omental bursa:</strong> Subdivision of the peritoneal cavity posterior to the stomach and lesser omentum.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The pancreas is a retroperitoneal gland that is exocrine (secretes digestive enzymes released into the duodenum) and endocrine (source of insulin and glucagon released into the bloodstream). It lies posterior to the omental bursa (lesser sac). The gland is anatomically divided into head, neck, body, and tail regions and is diagonally placed across the posterior abdominal wall. The head of the pancreas lies within the curve of the second and third parts of the duodenum, and its inferior portion forms a hook-like uncinate process that lies posterior to the superior mesenteric vessels. The neck lies at the L1 vertebral level, with the pylorus of the stomach immediately superior. The portal vein is formed posteriorly by the union of the splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein (SMV). The body of the gland passes superiorly to the left, with the tortuous splenic artery along its superior border. The short tail of the pancreas lies within the splenorenal ligament and may contact the hilum of the spleen.</p>
                <p>The exocrine pancreas is drained by a main pancreatic duct, which begins in the tail, and passes to the right through the body, neck, and inferior portion of the head. The duct pierces the wall of the second part of the duodenum in close association with the common bile duct, with which it typically unites to form the hepatopancreatic ampulla, which in turn opens through the major duodenal papilla. Several smooth muscle sphincters surround these ducts, which may enter the duodenum separately at the papilla. The superior portion of the head is drained by an accessory pancreatic duct that usually joins the main duct but may drain separately into the duodenum at the minor duodenal papilla. The head of the pancreas receives its arterial blood supply primarily from superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries from the celiac and superior mesenteric artery (SMA), respectively, whereas the neck, body, and tail receive branches from the splenic artery.</p>
                <p>The duodenum is the first, shortest, widest, and least mobile portion of the small intestine. It is anatomically subdivided into four parts, and its C-shaped configuration is intimately related to the pancreas. The superior or first part is the posteriorly directed continuation of the pylorus of the stomach, and it lies at the L1 vertebral level. Its first portion or ampulla (clinically, the duodenal cap) is intraperitoneal, within the hepatoduodenal ligament. The remainder is retroperitoneal. The descending or second part is retroperitoneal, lies opposite L1, L2, and L3, and receives the pancreatic and bile ducts (hepatopancreatic ampulla) at the major duodenal papilla on its posteromedial wall. The horizontal or third part is also retroperitoneal, passes to the left, and crosses L3. The SMA and SMV cross this part of the duodenum anteriorly. The ascending or fourth part lies on the left side of the L3 and L2 vertebrae and is retroperitoneal, except perhaps for the last few millimeters as it becomes continuous with the jejunum at the duodenojejunal junction, indicated anatomically by the suspensory ligament of Treitz. The duodenum is supplied by superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries from the celiac artery and SMA, respectively.</p>
                <p>The spleen is the largest lymph organ of the body and functions as if it were a lymph node for the circulatory system. It is intraperitoneal, being suspended in the left upper quadrant by the gastrosplenic and splenorenal ligaments (subdivisions of the greater omentum). It lies parallel to the 10th rib and overlaps the 9th and 11th ribs. It has a convex diaphragmatic surface and concave hilum, where the ligaments attach. The splenic artery (a major branch of the celiac artery) enters, and the splenic vein exits the spleen through the hilum and is within the splenorenal ligament in addition to the tail of the pancreas.</p>

                <h3>22.2 Clinical Case: Pancreatitis</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 30-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for severe constant abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting since the previous day. He states the pain radiates straight to his back and feels “like it’s boring a hole right through me from front to back.” He reports no other medical problems, but drinks one to two six-packs of beer each weekend. He denies diarrhea or fever. The serum amylase and lipase levels are markedly elevated.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Acute pancreatitis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical location of the structure affected:</strong> Retroperitoneal, posterior to the stomach and the lesser peritoneal sac (omental bursa).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 30-year-old man who drinks alcohol is admitted to the hospital for severe abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting for 24-hour duration. He states the pain radiates straight to his back. The serum amylase and lipase levels are markedly elevated.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> The pancreas is a retroperitoneal organ, posterior to the stomach and lesser sac, partly surrounded by the duodenum. It is an exocrine gland that secretes digestive enzymes and an endocrine gland that produces insulin and glucagon to regulate blood glucose levels. Noninfectious inflammation of the pancreas is most commonly caused by alcohol abuse or gallstones. The inflammation is secondary to autodigestion of the pancreatic tissue by the exocrine secretions. Marked vomiting is typical, and serum amylase or lipase levels are elevated. Immediate management includes restricting oral intake, monitoring fluid and electrolyte balance, and pain control. The pancreatitis sometimes may be so severe as to produce hemorrhage into the pancreas or pulmonary injury. These complications are associated with higher mortality rates.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>The liver, the largest internal organ, has a convex diaphragmatic surface that conforms to the curvature of the diaphragm and an irregular concave visceral surface. The liver is covered with visceral peritoneum over most of its surface and is suspended by several mesenteric structures called ligaments. The falciform ligament (with the round ligament of the liver, the adult remnant of the umbilical vein, in its free margin) is reflected onto the anterior abdominal wall and divides the liver into apparent right and left anatomical lobes. As the falciform ligament passes onto the superior surface of the liver, the two layers of peritoneum diverge to the right and to the left, creating the anterior layers of the coronary ligaments. These pass to the right and to the left to the extremes of the superior liver surface, turn back on themselves (creating the triangular ligaments), and turn posteriorly to form the posterior layers of the coronary ligaments. In this manner, an area devoid of visceral peritoneum is created, the bare area of the liver. The posterior layers of the coronary ligaments converge to form the lesser omentum, which passes from the visceral surface of the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach (hepatogastric ligament) and the first part of the duodenum (hepatoduodenal ligament).</p>
                <p>The liver is divided anatomically into four lobes by external landmarks and is delineated on the visceral surface by fissures and fossae, which form an “H.” The right side of the H is formed by fossae for the gallbladder and the IVC, and the right lobe lies to the right of these structures. The left side of the H is formed by the fissure for the round ligament and the ligamentum venosum (adult remnant of the ductus venosus); the left lobe is to the left of this fissure. The crossbar of the H is the porta hepatis through which the hepatic artery, portal vein, and nerves enter the liver and the bile ducts and lymphatics exit. The crossbar subdivides the central portion into quadrate and caudate lobes. Functionally, the right portal lobe lies to the right of the fossae of the gallbladder, IVC, and a portion of the caudate lobe. The left portal lobe is the left anatomical lobe, quadrate lobe, and the remainder of the caudate lobe. The portal lobes are supplied by lobar branches of the hepatic artery, portal vein, and bile ducts. Although lacking external landmarks, the portal lobes are further divided functionally into hepatic segments.</p>
                <p>The liver receives a dual blood supply; approximately 30 percent of the blood entering the organ is from the hepatic artery, and 70 percent is from the portal vein. The proper hepatic artery is a branch of the common hepatic artery, one of the three major branches of the celiac artery. As it approaches the liver, it divides into right and left hepatic branches that enter the liver and divide into lobar, segmental, and smaller branches. Eventually blood reaches the arterioles in the portal areas at the periphery of the hepatic lobules and, after providing oxygen and nutrients to the parenchyma, drain into the hepatic sinusoids. The majority of blood entering the liver is venous blood rich in nutrients and molecules absorbed by the gastrointestinal organs. Intrahepatic branches of the portal vein follow the arteries to the portal areas, where portal venules empty into the sinusoids from which molecules are extracted and added. Sinusoidal blood flows to the central vein of each lobule from which increasingly larger veins are formed until typically three hepatic veins exit the liver to join the IVC.</p>
                <p>The portal venous system arises from the capillary beds within the abdominal organs supplied by the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and blood will flow to and through the liver for metabolism of its contained molecules. Veins from these organs, for the most part, accompany arteries of the same name. The portal vein itself is formed by the union of the splenic vein and SMV posterior to the neck of the pancreas. This short, wide vein ascends within the hepatoduodenal ligament, posterior to the bile duct and hepatic artery, and enters the liver through the porta hepatis. Typically, the IMV drains its blood into the splenic vein. Portacaval (systemic) venous anastomoses occur at sites where blood may ultimately drain into the portal system and/or the vena caval system. If venous flow through the portal system is prevented by liver disease, for example, the absence of valves within the portal system veins allows reverse flow. This dilates the smaller veins and blood is drained by veins emptying into the vena cavae. This occurs at several sites and may produce clinical signs or symptoms.</p>

                <h3>23.2 Clinical Case: Cirrhosis</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 38-year-old man comes into the emergency department presenting with fatigue and abdominal swelling. For several months, he has noticed that his abdomen has been growing larger and that his skin has turned yellow. He denies any medical problems but admits to drinking alcohol almost every day. On examination, his skin clearly has a yellow hue indicative of icterus. His palms have some redness. His abdomen is markedly distended and tense, and a fluid wave is present. On the surface of the abdomen there are prominent vascular markings.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Alcoholic cirrhosis with portal hypertension.</li>
                    <li><strong>Organs likely affected:</strong> Liver and those drained by the portal venous system.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 38-year-old icteric man who abuses alcohol enters the emergency department for fatigue and abdominal “swelling.” He has palmar erythema and abdominal distention with a positive fluid wave and prominent vascular markings.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This patient abuses alcohol and has manifestations of end-stage liver disease (cirrhosis). Cirrhosis results in severe fibrotic scarring of the liver, which decreases blood flow through the organ. Hypertension in the portal venous system is the result, with collateral venous flow, especially in organs having venous drainage by the portal and vena caval systems, such as the abdominal surface, and the esophagus. The spleen is frequently enlarged, and the ascites, fluid within the peritoneal cavity, is due to liver insufficiency. Death may ensue due to bleeding from esophageal varices or bacterial peritonitis of the ascitic fluid. Marked hepatic insufficiency is another complication.</p>

                <p>The stomach, the first major gastrointestinal organ in which digestion occurs, produces digestive enzymes and hydrochloric acid (HCl). This continuation of the esophagus is a large, intraperitoneal, saccular organ that is suspended by the mesentery-like greater and lesser omenta. The stomach is divided anatomically into a cardia, fundus, body, and pylorus (pyloric antrum and canal with sphincter) and has greater and lesser curvatures. The greater omentum attaches to the greater curvature and drapes inferiorly to form a double-layered apron anterior to the abdominal cavity contents. It fuses superiorly with the transverse mesocolon. The greater omentum is subdivided into gastrocolic, gastrosplenic, splenorenal, and gastrophrenic ligament portions. The lesser omentum is attached to the lesser curvature and first part of the duodenum and extends to the visceral surface of the liver. With the stomach, it forms the anterior boundary of the omental bursa (lesser sac). The lesser omentum is divided into hepatogastric and hepatoduodenal ligaments, with the latter forming the anterior boundary of the epiploic foramen (of Winslow).</p>
                <p>The stomach is richly supplied by five sets of arteries, all of which are branches of the celiac artery (trunk). The celiac artery arises from the abdominal aorta opposite the upper portion of L1. This very short artery quickly divides into three branches. The smallest is the left gastric artery, which ascends toward the gastroesophageal junction at the lesser curvature. After sending small branches to the esophagus, it curves inferiorly within the lesser omentum, parallel to the lesser curvature, to which numerous gastric branches are provided. The splenic artery is a large, tortuous branch of the celiac that passes to the left, along the superior margin of the pancreas, to reach the spleen. It sends several branches to the pancreas and, as it approaches the spleen, gives off two sets of arteries to the stomach. Passing superiorly, four to five small short gastric arteries ascend within the gastrosplenic ligament to supply the fundus. Also near the spleen, the left gastro-omental (epiploic) artery arises from the splenic artery and passes inferiorly within the gastrosplenic and gastrocolic ligaments. It courses parallel to the greater curvature, to which it sends numerous branches. The last branch of the celiac is the common hepatic artery, which passes to the right to enter the hepatoduodenal ligament. The common hepatic divides into two branches. The proper hepatic artery ascends toward the liver within the hepatoduodenal ligament to supply the liver and gallbladder. The right gastric artery typically arises from the proper hepatic, descends to the gastroduodenal junction, curves superiorly and parallel to the lesser curvature, sends gastric branches to the stomach, and anastomoses with the left gastric artery. The other branch of the common hepatic artery is the gastroduodenal artery, which descends posterior to the first part of the duodenum and then divides into the pancreaticoduodenal and right gastro-omental arteries. This latter vessel lies within the gastrocolic ligament and courses to the left parallel to the greater curvature, to which gastric branches are sent. It anastomoses with the left gastro-omental along the greater curvature.</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 42-year-old male executive complains of abdominal pain that began about 6 months previously, is constant in nature especially after meals, and located in the upper midabdomen superior to the umbilicus. He also reports some “heartburn” that has been occurring during the previous year. He has been under a lot of job-related stress and has been self-medicating himself with over-the-counter antacids, with some relief. He states his stools have changed in color over the previous 2 months and now are intermittently dark and tarry in consistency. The physician tests the patient’s stool and finds occult blood.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Peptic ulcer disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Organs likely affected:</strong> Stomach or duodenum.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 42-year-old stressed-out male executive has a 6-month history of constant upper abdominal pain and heartburn for the past year that was relieved by over-the-counter antacids. His stools have become dark and tarry, which at examination, have occult blood.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This patient has a history typical for peptic ulcer disease, that is, constant midepigastric pain after meals. The patient also has symptoms consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease. The dark and tarry stools reflect blood in the stools, that is, hemoglobin has been converted to melena. This is suggestive of an upper gastrointestinal bleeding disorder. The next step would be an upper endoscopy to visualize the suspected ulcer. If the stomach is the site, a biopsy is usually performed to assess concurrent malignancy. Treatment includes a histamine-blocking agent, proton pump inhibitor, and antibiotic therapy. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori has been implicated in most cases of peptic ulcer disease. If an ulcer occurs in the duodenum, the posterior wall of the ampulla of the duodenum (duodenal cap) is the usual site. The gastroduodenal artery lies posterior to the duodenum at this point and is at risk in the event of ulcer perforation.</p>

                    <li><strong>Perinephric abscess:</strong> Collection of pus in the tissues surrounding the kidney.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pyelonephritis:</strong> Usually a bacterial inflammation of the renal tissue, the calyces, or renal pelvis.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The kidneys are paired retroperitoneal organs that are located in the paravertebral gutters. The left kidney lies slightly higher than the right, its hilum is at the level of L1, and its superior and inferior poles are at the 11th rib and L3, respectively. The hilum of the right kidney lies at the level of the disc between L1 and L2, and its inferior pole is nearly 1 to 2 cm superior to the iliac crest. Each kidney is an encapsulated solid organ, with an outer cortex and an inner medulla, with the latter arranged in renal pyramids. The hilum of each kidney leads to a space, the renal sinus, which contains fat, branches of the renal vessels, and the urine-collecting structures (minor and major calyces and renal pelvis). Within the sinus, the apex of the 6 to 12 renal pyramids is cupped by a minor calyx, which collects the urine produced. Typically two to three minor calyces unite to form a major calyx, and two to three major calyces form the renal pelvis. The renal pelvis is continuous with the ureter at the inferior margin of the hilum.</p>
                <p>Four muscles are related to each kidney posteriorly: the diaphragm superiorly and the transverses abdominis, quadratus lumborum, and psoas muscles inferiorly, from lateral to medial. The suprarenal glands and colon contact both kidneys anteriorly. The duodenum and liver also contact the right kidney anteriorly, and the stomach, pancreas, and spleen are related to the anterior left kidney.</p>
                <p>Each kidney and suprarenal gland is encased in a renal (Gerota) fascia, which helps to maintain the position of the kidney. The renal fascia fuses with the fascia of the psoas muscle posteriorly and with the adventitia of the renal vessels anteriorly. Within the renal fascia is an accumulation of fat known as perirenal fat, which is continuous with the fat within the renal sinus. Pararenal fat surrounds each kidney external to the renal fascia. Pararenal fat is thick posterior to the kidney, but thin anteriorly between the renal fascia and parietal peritoneum.</p>
                <p>Each kidney is supplied by a renal artery that arises from the aorta near vertebral level L2. As each artery nears the renal pelvis, it typically divides into five segmental arteries that enter the hilum to supply segments of renal tissue. The right renal artery is the longer artery, and both renal arteries lie posterior to the renal veins when entering the hilum. The renal veins exit the hilum anterior to the arteries, and the left vein is longer and crosses the midline. Both renal veins drain into the IVC. The left renal vein is unique in that the inferior phrenic, suprarenal, and gonadal veins drain into it (the IVC receives these veins on the right side).</p>

                <h3>25.2 Clinical Case: Perinephric Abscess</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 55-year-old male is admitted to the hospital for a suspected kidney infection. He is placed on intravenous antibiotic therapy but continues to have a temperature of 103°F after 3 days of therapy. The urine culture grows Escherichia coli, which is sensitive to the antibiotics being used. On examination, he appears ill and has marked left flank tenderness. Ultrasound depicts an abnormal collection of fluid around the left kidney.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Perinephric abscess.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical structure involved:</strong> Kidney and anatomically related structures.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 55-year-old male continues with high fever and flank pain despite 3 days of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy. The urine isolate of E. coli demonstrates in vitro sensitivity to the antibiotics used. Renal ultrasound shows fluid around the left kidney.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This 55-year-old male who is suspected of having pyelonephritis is not improving despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Pyelonephritis is an infection of the kidney parenchyma usually caused by an ascending infection of bacteria that advances from the urethra to bladder to ureters and then to the kidney. Kidney infection usually manifests as fever, flank tenderness, white cells in the urine, and serum leukocytosis. After 48 to 72 hours, one would expect decreases in fever and flank tenderness. E. coli is isolated, which is the bacterium that most often causes urinary tract infection. The ultrasound examination is performed to rule out complications of pyelonephritis. The two most common complications would be a nephrolithiasis or ureterolithiasis (kidney stone) and perinephric abscess. Intervention is required before improvement is seen. The abscess must be drained, usually by placement of a percutaneous catheter under radiologic guidance.</p>

                    <li>Describe the general pattern of lymphatic drainage of the abdomen.</li>

                <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Virilism:</strong> Presence of mature male characteristics in a female or a prepubescent male.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clitoromegaly:</strong> Enlargement of the clitoris.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dihydroepiandrostenedione (DHEA):</strong> Male steroid hormone secreted by the testis, ovary, or adrenal cortex.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The paired suprarenal glands are retroperitoneal endocrine glands composed of an outer cortex that secretes corticosteroid and androgen steroid hormones and an inner medulla (derived from neural crest cells) that secretes the catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine. Each gland sits on the superior pole of each kidney, enclosed within the renal fascia, and, hence, embedded in the perirenal fat. The right suprarenal gland is somewhat triangular and is closely related to the IVC, liver, and diaphragm. The left gland is shaped like a comma and related to the spleen, pancreas, stomach, and diaphragm. The suprarenal glands receive their blood supply from multiple small branches that arise from the inferior phrenic, aorta, and renal arteries. Each gland is drained by a single suprarenal vein that terminates in the IVC on the right, and the renal vein on the left.</p>
                <p>The lymphatic drainage of the abdomen is diagrammatically summarized in Figure 26-1. In general, the lymphatic drainage of abdominal organs reversely follows their arterial blood supply. Thus the lymph drainage from organs supplied by the SMA will be to the superior mesenteric nodes by way of vessels and other node groups located along the branches of the SMA. If a “final common pathway” for lymph drainage in the abdomen could be named, it would be the lumbar (aortic) lymph nodes, and lymph from these nodes drains to the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct. Lymph from the suprarenal glands drains into the lumbar lymph nodes. Lymphatics from the gonads also drain to the upper lumbar nodes as the gonadal vessels arise in the upper abdomen (reflecting the site of their embryologic origin). Note also that the pectinate line in the anal canal is a watershed with regard to lymphatic drainage. The anal canal and rectum superior to this line have their lymph drained to iliac nodes; inferior to this line, lymph drains to inguinal nodes.</p>

                <h3>26.2 Clinical Case: Suprarenal Gland Tumor</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>An 18-year-old female presents with increasing hair growth on her face and chest, deepening of her voice, and acne over the past year. She has no history of other medical problems. On examination, she has acne, abnormal male pattern balding, and enlargement of her clitoris. The pelvic examination is normal including the ovaries. Blood tests show that the serum testosterone levels are normal, but that the level of dihydroepiandrostenedione sulfate, an adrenal androgen, is markedly elevated.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Suprarenal (adrenal) gland tumor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Organs likely affected:</strong> Suprarenal glands.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> An 18-year-old female is seen for increasing hirsutism, deepening voice, and acne over the past year. She has no other medical problems. On examination she displays acne, hirsutism, temporal balding, and clitoromegaly. The pelvic examination, including the ovaries, is normal. The testosterone level is normal, and the level of dihydroepiandrostenedione sulfate is markedly elevated.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This young female has more than hirsutism, which is increased hair growth. She also has virilism, or the effects of androgens on the skin, voice, and clitoris. The hyperandrogenism seems to be of acute onset, which is consistent with an androgen-secreting tumor. The two possibilities include an ovarian tumor, usually Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, or an adrenal tumor. Because the pelvic examination and testosterone levels are normal, an ovarian etiology is less likely. Moreover, the high level of dihydroepiandrostenedione sulfate almost establishes the suprarenal (adrenal) gland as the cause. The next step would be a CT or MRI scan of the suprarenal glands to determine the exact location of the tumor. Usually surgery is indicated. Another cause of hirsutism is polycystic ovarian syndrome, which includes hirsutism, obesity, anovulation, and irregular menses. Cushing syndrome or disease presents strong cortisol effects, such as buffalo hump, abdominal striae, easy bruising, and central obesity.</p>

                <p>The perineum is defined as the region of the trunk, between the thighs and buttocks, inferior to the pelvic diaphragm. It is bounded bilaterally by the pubic symphysis (anterior), ischiopubic ramus (anterolateral), ischial tuberosity (lateral), sacrotuberous ligament (posterolateral), and the coccyx (posterior). A line between the ischial tuberosities divides the perineum into anterior and posterior urogenital and anal triangles, respectively. Deep to the skin is the fatty layer of superficial fascia, a continuation of a similar layer in the abdomen (Camper fascia). In the abdomen, deep to the fatty layer is the membranous layer of superficial fascia (Scarpa fascia) that continues into the perineum where it is called Colles fascia. In the perineum, Colles fascia is attached laterally to the fascia lata of the thigh and to the posterior border of the perineal membrane and the perineal body. The perineal membrane is a thin but strong fascial sheet attached to the ischiopubic rami, thus stretching across the urogenital triangle. The potential space between the deep layer of the superficial (Colles) fascia and the perineal membrane is the superficial perineal pouch (space). Attached to the superior surface of the perineal membrane are the deep transverse perineal and sphincter urethrae muscles within the deep perineal pouch (space). The perineal body attaches to the posterior edge of the membrane at its midpoint.</p>
                <p>Superficial to the perineal membrane, the pudendum or vulva (external genitalia) includes the mons pubis and labia majora, labia minora, vaginal vestibule, bulbs of the vestibule, greater vestibular (Bartholin) glands, clitoris, and the associated ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles. The mons pubis is a rounded, hair-covered elevation anterior to the pubic symphysis formed by a mass of the fatty layer of the superficial fascia. Fat-filled posterior extensions of the mons form the hair-covered labia majora, which are united by anterior and posterior commissures. The space between the two labia is the pudendal cleft. Medial to each labia majora are the thin, fat-free, hairless labia minora that are filled with erectile tissue and surround the vestibule of the vagina, which contains the urethral and vaginal orifices. The labia minora are united posteriorly by the frenulum of the labia minora or fourchette. Anteriorly, the two labia minora are united by extensions that pass anterior and posterior to the glans of the clitoris as the prepuce and frenulum of the clitoris, respectively. The clitoris is composed of paired cylinders of erectile tissue or corpora cavernosa attached to the ischiopubic rami as the two crura and are surrounded by the ischiocavernosus muscles. The corpora cavernosa converge toward the pubic symphysis to form the body, which is sharply flexed inferiorly and terminates as the glans anterior to the urethral orifice. Superiorly (deep) to the labia majora and minora, at the margins of the vestibule, are the paired bulbs of the vestibule. At the posterior ends of the bulbs and partially embedded in them are the paired greater vestibular (Bartholin) glands. The bulbs and glands are covered by the bulbospongiosus muscles. A superficial transverse perineal muscle lies along the posterior edge of the perineal membrane and attaches laterally to the ischial tuberosity and medially to the perineal body. The components of the clitoris, bulb of the vestibule, greater vestibular gland, bulbospongiosus, and ischiocavernosus muscles are encased in the deep perineal or investing (Gallaudet) fascia. The bulbospongiosus, superficial and deep transverse perineal, and external anal sphincter muscles attach to the perineal body.</p>
                <p>The lymphatic drainage of the perineum is primarily to the superficial inguinal lymph nodes, which lie inferior and parallel to the inguinal ligament. Efferent vessels from this group drain lymph to the external iliac nodes, but some lymph does drain to the deep inguinal nodes, which then drain to the external iliac nodes. Small amounts of lymph from deep perineal structures drain to the internal iliac nodes.</p>

                <h3>27.2 Clinical Case: Greater Vestibular (Bartholin) Gland Abscess</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 27-year-old female notes a tender lump in her groin area that appeared approximately 3 weeks ago. She relates that she had a similar mass about 1 year ago that required minor surgery. On physical examination, she is afebrile, and inspection of the perineum shows a 3 × 2-cm fluctuant mass at the 5-o’clock position of the vestibule. It is mildly tender, red, and slightly warm to the touch.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Greater vestibular (Bartholin) gland abscess.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cause of groin lump:</strong> Inguinal lymph nodes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 27-year-old female notes a tender lump in the groin that appeared 3 weeks ago. She had surgery for a similar mass a year ago. The patient is afebrile and has a 3 × 2-cm fluctuant, inflamed mass at the 5-o’clock position of the vestibule.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This young woman notes the appearance of an inflamed, perineal, or vulvar mass in the posterolateral region of the vestibule. She apparently had a similar lesion 1 year previously. These are very consistent with a greater vestibular (Bartholin) gland infection. The greater vestibular glands are located at the 5- and 7-o’clock positions of the vulva. If the ducts of the glands become obstructed, the glands may enlarge and become infected, usually with multiple organisms other than those responsible for sexually transmitted diseases. Lymphatic drainage of the vulva is first to the inguinal lymph nodes. Treatment for this patient is to create a fistulous tract to decrease the incidence of recurrence; the two most common methods are incision and drainage with a catheter left in place for several weeks and marsupialization of the cyst wall, which is suturing the inner lining of the cyst wall to the epithelium around the periphery of the cyst. Biopsy is typically not required in a young patient, but for vulvar masses or abnormalities in women older than 40 years it is required to rule out malignancy.</p>

                <p>The male external genitalia consist of the penis and the scrotum, which contains the testes, the male gonad. All of these structures lie within the boundaries of the urogenital triangle of the perineum. The relations of the perineal fascia and spaces (pouches) of the male perineum are similar to those described for the female perineum. For example, the membranous layer of the superficial fascia attaches to the posterior margin of the perineal membrane, the same three superficial perineal muscles are surrounded by the deep perineal fascia, and superficial and deep spaces are present. However, in the male perineum, the fatty layer of the superficial fascia is virtually absent on the penis and is replaced by smooth (dartos) muscles in the scrotum. The membranous layer of the superficial fascia is continuous in the penis and scrotum as the dartos fascia.</p>
                <p>The penis is developmentally homologous to the clitoris in the female and has many anatomical similarities. However, the urethra traverses the corpus spongiosum. The penis consists of root, body, and glans, which are formed from three cylindrical bodies of erectile tissue, each surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule called the tunica albuginea. Paired corpora cavernosa attach to the posterior portion of the ischiopubic rami (the crura of the penis) and converge anteriorly at the pubic symphysis. The paired bodies fuse with each other and are flexed inferiorly. The single corpus spongiosum begins as an expanded region called the bulb of the penis, which is attached to the inferior surface of the perineal membrane, and into which the urethra passes. The crura and bulb form the root of the penis. The corpus spongiosum with the urethra within it courses anteriorly to meet and fuse with the paired corpora cavernosa and form the body of the penis. The distal portion of the corpus spongiosum is expanded as the glans, which caps the distal ends of the paired corpora cavernosa. The external urethral orifice is at the tip of the glans. The three fused erectile bodies are surrounded by a deep (Buck) fascia, thin loose connective tissue, and thin, somewhat pigmented skin. The glans is covered by a redundant fold of skin called the prepuce (foreskin) and is removed if a child is circumcised. The posterior crural portion of the corpora cavernosa are covered with ischiocavernosus muscles, and the corpus spongiosum is covered by the paired bulbospongiosus muscles. Superficial transverse perineal muscles are also present at the posterior margin of the perineal membrane and attach to the perineal body.</p>
                <p>The scrotum is a sac of pigmented skin and the dartos fascial layer, which contains smooth muscle fibers that produce the characteristic wrinkling of the skin. The scrotum is posteroinferior to the penis and is divided into two compartments by an internal septum. Each compartment contains a testis, epididymis, and the spermatic cord. Each testis is ovoid with a thick fibrous capsule, the tunica albuginea, from which incomplete connective tissue septa divide the interior into lobules. The lobules contain testosterone-producing interstitial cells (of Leydig) and coiled seminiferous tubules where spermatozoa (sperm) are produced. The seminiferous tubules converge toward the posteriorly located mediastinum to form tubules (straight tubules, rete testes, and efferent tubules), which convey sperm to the epididymis. The epididymis is the comma-shaped structure attached to the posterior surface of the testis and is composed of the highly convoluted ductus epididymis. The testis and epididymis are surrounded by a closed, double-layered peritoneal sac embryologically derived from the process vaginalis. The inner portion or the visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis is applied to the surface of the testis and epididymis and is continuous posteriorly with an outer, parietal layer of the tunica vaginalis. A small cavity with lubricating fluid separates the two layers.</p>
                <p>The epididymis is continuous inferiorly with the ductus (vas) deferens, which courses superiorly to enter the superficial inguinal ring. The ductus deferens in addition to the testicular, deferential, and cremasteric arteries, pampiniform plexus of veins, genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve, autonomic nerve fibers, and lymphatic vessels are components of the spermatic cord. The testis, epididymis, and spermatic cord are encased in three fascial layers derived from layers of the anterior abdominal wall.</p>
                <p>The testes are supplied by the testicular arteries that arise from the abdominal aorta, just inferior to the renal arteries. They course retroperitoneally to reach the deep inguinal ring, crossing anteriorly to the ureters and external iliac vessels. They traverse the inguinal canal to enter the scrotum through the superficial inguinal ring. Venous drainage of the testes is by the pampiniform plexus of veins, which follow a reverse course through the inguinal rings and canal, to become paired testicular veins near their entrance into the abdomen. Eventually, a single testicular vein is formed that drains into the IVC on the right side but enters the left renal vein on the left side. Lymphatic vessels ascend along the paths of the testicular vessels, to drain lymph into lumbar and preaortic lymph nodes at the level of origin of the arteries. This high abdominal position of arterial origin and lymphatic drainage reflects the embryological site where the testes were formed.</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 20-year-old male reports that he has had a nontender, heavy sensation in his scrotal area for 2 months. He jogs several miles every day but denies lifting heavy objects. He does not recall trauma to the area, has no urinary complaints, does not smoke, and otherwise appears healthy. His blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 80 beats/min, and he is without fever. Heart and lungs examinations are normal. His back and abdomen are nontender, and no abdominal masses are detected. External genitalia examination reveals a 2-cm nontender mass in the right testicle that shows no light penetration with transillumination. The rectal examination is unremarkable.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Testicular cancer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Organs likely affected:</strong> Right testicle.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 20-year-old male is noted to have a nontender heavy sensation in the scrotal area of 2 months’ duration. He jogs several miles each day and denies lifting heavy objects, scrotal trauma, and urinary problems. A 2-cm, nontender, nontransilluminating mass is noted in the right testicle. The rectal examination is unremarkable.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Testicular carcinoma affects young men, usually between ages 15 and 40 years, and the presence of a painless scrotal mass is the most common presentation. A history of trivial scrotal trauma is not uncommon, which often brings the scrotal mass to the patient’s attention. Testicular carcinoma should be ruled out before other conditions are considered, such as varicocele, spermatocele, hydrocele, epididymitis, or testicular torsion. Regular scrotal examination is advocated but rarely performed, and personal embarrassment often delays medical consultation.</p>

                <p>The uterus or womb is a thick-walled, hollow, pear-shaped, pelvic organ. Its main parts are the body and cervix. The fundus is the superior portion of the body between the openings of the uterine tubes, and the isthmus is the narrowed inferior portion of the body at its junction with the cervix. The narrow uterine cervix protrudes into the anterior wall of the upper vagina. The lumen of the cervix is the cervical canal, and its superior part opens into the uterine cavity as the internal os, and its inferior part opens into the vagina as the external os. The uterus is usually angled anteriorly in relation to the vagina, or anteverted, and the body and cervix of the uterus are flexed anteriorly with respect to each other, or anteflexed. This places the body of the uterus superior to the urinary bladder, often deforming it on cystograms. Posterior to the cervix is the rectum. The vagina, a tubular structure that is closed anteroposteriorly, begins at the vestibule and is directed posterosuperiorly to the level of the cervix. The protrusion of the cervix into the anterior wall of the vagina creates a circumferential gutter around the cervix, which, although a continuous space, is typically referred to as the anterior, posterior, or lateral fornix. The urethra is embedded in the anterior wall of the vagina. The columnar epithelium, which lines the uterine cavity and cervical canal, changes to a nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium at the margins of the external os. This type of epithelium covers the external surface of the cervix and lines the vagina.</p>
                <p>The uterine (fallopian) tubes extend posterolaterally from the superolateral region of the uterus, the uterine horns. The uterine tubes are divided, from medial to lateral, into four regions: a uterine or intramural portion within the wall of the uterus, the narrowest portion or isthmus, the widest portion or ampulla, and the funnel-shaped infundibulum. The lumen of the infundibulum opens into the abdominal cavity, and its margin is arranged in a series of finger-like structures called fimbriae, one of which is usually attached to the ovary. The female gonads, the ovaries, lie close to the lateral pelvic wall, just inferior to the pelvic brim. Each almond-shaped ovary is supported by a suspensory (infundibulopelvic) ligament, which consists of the peritoneally covered ovarian vessels, an ovarian ligament, a derivative of the proximal portion of the embryonic gubernaculum, and the mesovarium portion of the broad ligament.</p>
                <p>The uterus, uterine tubes, and ovary are draped by a mesentery, the broad ligament, which passes from the sides of the uterus to the lateral pelvic wall to divide the pelvic cavity into anterior and posterior compartments. The broad ligament has three subdivisions: a shelf-like portion derived from the posterior layer of the broad ligament that attaches to the ovary, called the mesovarium, the portion of the broad ligament superior to the mesovarium that attaches to the uterine tube, called the mesosalpinx, and the portion from the uterus to the lateral pelvic wall, called the mesometrium. The continuation of peritoneum from the anterior surface of the uterus onto the anterior placed urinary bladder creates the uterovesicular pouch. Similarly, the continuation of peritoneum from the posterior uterine surface onto the anterior surface of the rectum creates the rectouterine pouch (of Douglas), the most inferior recess of the abdominopelvic cavity in the female.</p>
                <p>The uterus and uterine tubes are covered with a layer of visceral peritoneum, but the ovary is not, being covered instead by a cuboidal germinal epithelium. The ovarian ligament is a cord-like structure between the layers of the mesovarium that extends from the uterine pole of the ovary to the uterine horn. Its continuation anteriorly to and through the deep inguinal ring and inguinal canal to the labia majora is the round ligament of the uterus (also derived from the gubernaculum). Beneath the peritoneum of the pelvic floor, paired condensations of connective tissue, the uterosacral ligaments, pass from the uterine cervix to the sacrum. An additional pair of condensation passes from the cervix to the lateral pelvic wall, the transverse cervical (cardinal) ligaments. The transverse cervical ligaments lie in the base of the mesometrium, and the uterine vessels lie within or very close to these ligaments. The ureters coursing anteromedially on their way to the urinary bladder pass inferiorly to the uterine vessels (mnemonic: water under the bridge) and continue anteriorly, approximately 2 cm laterally to the uterine cervix.</p>
                <p>The blood supply to the uterus consists primarily of the paired uterine arteries and the ovarian arteries. The uterine arteries arise from the internal iliac arteries and traverse through the transverse cervical (cardinal) ligaments. The fundus (top) of the uterus is supplied mainly by the ovarian arteries, which arise from the abdominal aorta. Lymphatic drainage from the fundus and body of the uterus is to the lumbar abdominal nodes and to the external iliac nodes. The cervical lymph drainage is primarily to external iliac nodes, but some lymph drains to internal iliac and sacral nodes. Drainage from the upper vagina is similar to that of the cervix, to the external and internal iliac lymph nodes.</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 50-year-old female who has borne five children complains that she has noticed vaginal spotting of blood after intercourse for approximately the past 6 months. More recently, she has had a foul-smelling vaginal discharge and indicates that her left leg seems larger than her right one. She previously had syphilis. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years. Examination of her back shows left flank tenderness. The circumferences of her left thigh and calf are larger than those of the right. Pelvic examination shows normal female external genitalia and a 3-cm growth on the surface on the left lip of the uterine cervix.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Metastatic cervical cancer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Applied anatomy for this condition:</strong> Extension of the tumor to obstruct the left ureter and metastasis to iliac lymph nodes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 50-year-old female who has borne five children complains of a 6-month history of spotting after intercourse and foul-smelling vaginal discharge. She has had syphilis and is a smoker. Left costovertebral tenderness is present, and the left lower limb is swollen. Speculum examination of the uterine cervix shows a 3-cm growth of the left lip of the cervix.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This patient’s age, multiple pregnancies, and histories of smoking and a sexually transmitted disease are risk factors for cervical cancer. Vaginal spotting after intercourse is a common presenting sign for cervical cancer in a sexually active woman. Cervical cancer typically arises at the squamocolumnar epithelial junction, and the foul-smelling discharge suggests necrosis of a portion of this large tumor. Such a tumor can spread inferiorly to involve the vagina or laterally into the region of the transverse cervical (cardinal) ligament and can obstruct the ureter, which passes through the ligament. Further growth may reach the lateral pelvic wall. Involvement of iliac lymph nodes, in particular the external iliac nodes, may inhibit lymphatic drainage of the lower limb with resultant edema. Bilateral ureteral obstruction can lead to uremia, the most common cause of death in this disease. Radiotherapy is the primary treatment for advanced cervical cancer.</p>

                <h3>29.3 Comprehension Questions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>A 31-year-old woman is in her physician’s office for a fitting for an intrauterine contraceptive device. The physician performs a pelvic examination to ensure that the device is placed in the correct direction. The physical examination shows that the uterine body is tipped toward the rectum and that the uterine fundus is tipped anteriorly. Which of the following describes the position of the uterus?
                        <ol type="A">
                            <li>Anteverted, anteflexed</li>
                            <li>Anteverted, retroflexed</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C. “Version” refers to the relation between the uterus and the vagina, whereas “flexion” denotes the relation between the body and the cervix. Thus, this uterus is retroverted and anteflexed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>A 45-year-old woman is having significant uterine bleeding from uterine fibroids. The radiologist performs an embolization procedure of the uterine arteries. Through which of the following structures do the uterine arteries traverse?
                        <ol type="A">

                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A. The uterine arteries travel through the transverse cervical ligaments.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>A 20-gauge spinal needle is placed through the vagina to assess whether there is blood in the peritoneal cavity. Which of the following describes the most dependent part of the peritoneum or pelvis?

                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> D. The most dependent region of the pelvis is the rectouterine pouch of Douglas. The procedure described is called a culdocentesis, in which the spinal needle is placed through the posterior vaginal fornix.</p>

                <p>The uterine (fallopian) tubes extend posterolaterally from the uterine horns and are divided, from medial to lateral, into four regions. The uterine or intramural portion lies within the wall of the uterus. The narrowest portion, or isthmus, lies just laterally to the uterine horns. More laterally, the widest and longest portion of the tube is the ampulla. This is the usual site of fertilization. The most lateral portion or infundibulum is funnel-shaped. The lumen of the infundibulum faces posteriorly into the abdominal cavity, inferior to which is the rectouterine pouch (of Douglas). The margin of the infundibulum is arranged in a series of finger-like structures called fimbriae, one of which is usually attached to the ovary. This attachment helps keep the infundibulum in close anatomical relation to the ovary, which in turn helps ensure that an ovulated egg will enter the lumen of the tube. The uterine tube is supported by the mesosalpinx portion of the broad ligament.</p>
                <p>The ovaries, uterine tubes, and fundus of the uterus are supplied by the ovarian arteries, which arise from the abdominal aorta just inferior to the renal arteries (in a manner similar to the testicular arteries). The arteries descend, crossing the ureters anteriorly, and also cross the iliac vessels anteriorly at the pelvic brim. The ureters lie just medial at the pelvic brim. The arteries enter the lateral pole of each ovary, supply it, and continue medially between the layers of the mesosalpinx, close to its attachment to the uterine tube. It supplies the tube, continues on to supply the fundus of the uterus, and anastomoses with the artery from the opposite side. The isthmus and uterine portions of the tube also receive blood from ascending branches of the uterine arteries, which anastomose with the ovarian artery. This accounts for the increased hemorrhage with a ruptured tubal pregnancy of the isthmus. Venous drainage from these structures is primarily through the ovarian veins, which empty into the IVC on the right side and into the left renal vein on the left side.</p>

                <p>A 19-year-old female who has borne one healthy child is being seen at 7 weeks’ gestation based on her last menstrual period and her complaints of vaginal spotting and lower abdominal pain. She denies the passage of any tissue through the vagina, trauma, or recent intercourse. Her medical history is significant for a pelvic infection approximately 3 years previously. On examination, her blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, heart rate is 110 beats/min, and temperature is within normal limits. The abdomen is normal, and bowel sounds are present and normal. On pelvic examination, the external genitalia and uterus palpate as normal. There is moderate right adnexal tenderness with palpation. Quantitative human β-corticotropin gonadotropin is 2300 mIU/mL, and transvaginal sonogram displays an empty uterus and some free fluid in the cul-de-sac.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 19-year-old female who has borne one child is seen at 7 weeks’ gestation by last menstrual period and vaginal spotting. She has a history of a pelvic infection. Her blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, heart rate is 110 beats/min, and the abdomen is mildly tender. Pelvic examination shows a normal uterus and some moderate adnexal tenderness. Quantitative human β-corticotropin gonadotropin is 2300 mIU/mL, and transvaginal sonogram shows an empty uterus and some free fluid in the cul-de-sac.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> An ectopic pregnancy results when a blastocyst implants outside the lumen of the uterus. The vast majority of ectopic pregnancies occurs in the uterine tube (95 to 97 percent), in the ampulla, the usual site of fertilization, or the isthmus, the narrowest portion. Any condition that might prevent or delay transport of the zygote to the uterus may cause an ectopic tubal pregnancy, and this patient’s history of a pelvic infection (pelvic inflammatory disease) is a risk factor. Tubal ectopic pregnancies will usually rupture during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy, typically resulting in abortion of the embryo and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, with resultant hypotension and tachycardia. Tubal pregnancy in the narrow isthmus tends to rupture sooner than those in the ampulla and produce greater hemorrhage than implantation in the ampulla. Blastocysts implanted in the ampulla may be expelled into the abdominal cavity, where they may reimplant on the surface of the ovary, the peritoneum of the rectouterine pouch (of Douglas), mesentery, or organ surface. Severe hemorrhage typically results from an abdominal ectopic pregnancy, and the resulting hypotension may be emergent. The free fluid seen on ultrasound is blood that has resulted from the ruptured ectopic pregnancy.</p>

                </ul>
                <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prostatic hyperplasia:</strong> Benign enlargement of the prostate gland that, because of the capsule surrounding it, impinges on the urethra.</li>
                    <li><strong>Urinary hesitancy:</strong> Abnormally long period required to initiate a stream of urine.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The paired ductus deferenses traverse the inguinal canal and enter the abdomen through the deep inguinal rings, where they retain a retroperitoneal position. They cross the external iliac vessels, superolateral surface of the bladder, and superiorly to the ureters entering the bladder (mnemonic: water under the bridge), and reach the posterior surface of the bladder, just anterior to the rectal vesicular pouch. The terminal portion of the ductus is dilated to form an ampulla of the prostate. Lateral to the two ampullae are the diagonally positioned, paired seminal vesicles. These accessory sex glands produce an alkaline component of semen, which neutralizes the usual acid environment in the vagina. The duct of each seminal vesicle unites with the ductus deferens on each side to form the paired ejaculatory ducts, which course anteroinferiorly through the prostate gland to open on the elevated seminal colliculus on the posterior wall of the prostatic urethra.</p>
                <p>The prostate gland is the largest of the accessory sex glands, an inverted pyramid about the size of a walnut. The base is located inferior to the neck of the bladder, and the apex rests on the sphincter urethrae muscle. The prostate has a thick fibrous capsule surrounded by a fibrous sheath that is continuous with the puboprostatic ligaments. The levator ani muscle supports the gland inferolaterally, and the anterior surface is covered by fibers of the sphincter urethrae muscle. The prostate is anatomically divisible into four lobes. The anterior lobe lies anteriorly to the urethra and is a superior fibromuscular continuation of the sphincter urethrae muscle. The posterior lobe is midline, posterior to the urethra, and palpable by digital rectal exam (DRE). The lateral lobes on each side of the posterior lobe form the largest part of the gland and are also palpable by DRE. The middle lobe is the wedge-shaped superior portion of gland between the urethra and the obliquely oriented ejaculatory ducts and is closely related to the neck of the bladder. Enlargement of the middle lobe (as in BPH) causes pressure on the neck of the bladder. The multiple ducts of the prostate open onto the posterior wall of the prostatic urethra and comprise a major component of semen. The paired bulbourethral glands are pea-size glands embedded in the sphincter urethrae muscle, posterolateral to the membranous urethra. The ducts of each gland empty into the proximal part of the spongy (penile) urethra, in the bulb of the penis. Their mucous secretions lubricate the urethra during erection.</p>
                <p>The male urethra is divided into four parts. The preprostatic urethra is a short continuation of the bladder neck. The prostatic urethra, the widest part, passes through the prostate gland, somewhat closer to its anterior surface. The posterior wall is elevated as a fusiform ridge called the seminal colliculus, on which are found the openings of the prostatic utricle (an embryonic remnant) and the paired ejaculatory ducts. The grooved portions of the urethra on each side of the colliculus are the prostatic sinus in which are found the openings of the prostatic gland ducts. The third part is called the membranous urethra and is surrounded by the sphincter urethrae muscle or the external urethral (voluntary) sphincter. The fourth and longest part is the spongy (penile) urethra, which traverses the corpus spongiosum and terminates at the external urethral orifice on the tip of the glans penis. As the urethra enters the bulb of the penis, it widens to form the bulbar fossa into which open the ducts of the bulbourethral glands. The urethra widens again just proximal to the external orifice as the navicular fossa.</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 63-year-old male complains of a 6-month history of difficulty voiding and feeling as though he cannot empty his bladder completely. After voiding, he often feels as though he needs to urinate again. He denies urethral discharge or burning with urination. He has had mild hypertension and takes a thiazide diuretic. His only other medication has been ampicillin for two urinary tract infections during the previous year. On examination, his blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg, pulse rate is 80 beats/min, and he is without fever (afebrile). The heart and lung examinations are normal, and the abdominal examination shows no masses.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Benign prostatic hyperplasia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical basis for the symptomatology:</strong> Compression of the bladder neck or the prostatic urethra.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 63-year-old male who has hypertension complains of a 6-month difficulty in voiding and the sensation that he cannot empty his bladder completely. He has had two episodes of urinary tract infections but denies dysuria (burning with urination) or urethral discharge.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> The prostate gland is the largest of the male accessory sex glands, and its secretions contribute to semen. This encapsulated gland is located in the pelvis, between the neck of the bladder and the sphincter urethrae muscle, and surrounds the first part of the male urethra, called the prostatic urethra. Enlargement of the prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), is a common condition in men older than 50 years and appears to depend on age and hormone level. A prostate-specific antigen blood test and a digital rectal examination (DRE) would be done to evaluate the gland’s size and the presence of nodularity that might suggest carcinoma. Initial treatment after a confirmed diagnosis of BPH is often medical, with a medication such as a 5-α-reductase inhibitor, which relaxes the smooth muscle within the stroma of the gland and thus increases urethral diameter. Other medications block the effects of testosterone metabolites on gland tissue, resulting in involution of gland tissue. In advanced cases, a surgical transurethral resection of the prostate may be required. Although no direct relation between BPH and prostate malignancy has been proved, both conditions occur in the same age group.</p>

                    <li><strong>Ureteral injury:</strong> Ligation, laceration, or denuding the ureter leading to ischemia. Ureteral obstruction can also occur from “kinking” of the ureter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intravenous pyelogram:</strong> Intravenous dye is injected and a series of radiographs are taken that incorporate the kidneys, ureter, and bladder. This procedure allows delineation of the anatomical structures and the function of the kidneys.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each ureter is an inferior continuation of the renal pelvis, and the ureteropelvic junction is at the inferior margin of the hilum of the kidney. One-half the total length of the ureter is abdominal, and the remaining half is located in the pelvis. The abdominal ureter descends retroperitoneally on the anterior surface of the psoas muscle and at about its midpoint is crossed anteriorly by the gonadal arteries (testicular/ovarian). The left ureter lies at the apex of the mesosigmoid. It enters the pelvis by crossing anterior to the external iliac artery (it may cross the common iliac bifurcation somewhat medially). In females, the ovarian vessels lie just lateral to the ureters as they enter the pelvis. After entering the pelvis, each ureter passes inferoposteriorly, anterior to the internal iliac vessels, to above the ischial spines. They then course anteromedially to the posterior bladder wall. In this course in a female, the ureters pass inferior to the uterine vessels, reaching the uterus from the lateral pelvic wall (mnemonic: water under the bridge), and lie approximately 1 cm lateral to the uterine cervix. Externally, the ureters enter the bladder approximately 5 cm apart but course obliquely through the bladder wall such that their internal openings are but 2.5 cm apart.</p>
                <p>Each ureter is anatomically narrowed in three locations: the ureteropelvic junction, where the ureters cross the external iliac vessels, and as the ureters obliquely traverse the bladder wall. Renal stones may lodge at these narrowed points. The pelvic portion of the ureters is at surgical risk, especially in females during hysterectomy procedures. If an oophorectomy is performed with the hysterectomy, the ovarian vessels must be ligated, and each ureter lies just medial to these vessels within the suspensory ligament of the ovary. They may be inadvertently clamped, ligated, or divided at this site. The ureters are at risk as they pass inferiorly to the uterine vessels, in or adjacent to the transverse cervical (cardinal) ligament, where they may also be inadvertently clamped, ligated, or divided. The ureters are at risk in a vaginal hysterectomy as they course just laterally to the uterine cervix.</p>
                <p>The arterial blood supply of the ureters is likely to come from any nearby artery, and its chief supply is derived from ureteral branches from the renal, gonadal, aorta, common and internal iliac, and vesical and uterine arteries. Ureteric branches reach the ureters from their medial side and divide into ascending and descending branches.</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 45-year-old female underwent surgical removal of the uterus (total hysterectomy) for symptomatic endometriosis 2 days previously. She complains of right back and flank tenderness. On examination, her temperature is 102°F, heart rate is 100 beats/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. The heart and lung examinations are normal. Her abdomen is slightly tender diffusely, but bowel sounds are normal. The surgical incision appears within normal limits. There is exquisite right costovertebral angle tenderness on palpation. Ultrasound of the kidneys shows marked dilation of the right renal collecting system and dilation of the right ureter.</p>

                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Injury to the right ureter.</li>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 45-year-old female who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy for symptomatic endometriosis 2 days previously has fever of 102°F and exquisite right flank tenderness at the costovertebral angle. The surgical incision appears normal.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Approximately one-half the length of the ureter is located in the pelvis. It is at risk of injury at three pelvic sites during a hysterectomy. If the patient’s ovaries are also removed (oophorectomy) at the time of the hysterectomy, the ureter is at risk where it crosses the common or external iliac vessels to enter the pelvis just medial to the ovarian vessels. The ureter is especially at risk deeper in the pelvis as it courses toward the urinary bladder inferior to the uterine vessels. Lateral extension of uterine pathology into the transverse cervical ligament increases the risk. The third site at which the ureter is at risk is as it passes laterally to the uterine cervix before its entrance into the urinary bladder. Hydronephrosis and/or hydroureter results from ureteral injury, and cystoscopic stent passage is often attempted first to relieve the obstruction, if possible.</p>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> B. The urinary and paramesonephric ducts are in close proximity anatomically and relationally during embryologic development. Thus, a congenital abnormality in the kidney or ureter often is associated with an abnormality of the ipsilateral tube, uterine horn, or cervix. The distal vagina, vulva, and ovary are of different embryonic origin.</p>

                    <li><strong>Symphysis:</strong> A secondary cartilaginous joint, in which two cartilaginous surfaces are held in place by a fibrous connective tissue, such as the intervertebral disc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The vertebral column is a series of individual bones that are stacked vertically and held together by ligaments and muscles. There are 32 to 34 vertebrae (7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 3 to 5 coccygeal). The joints between each vertebra provide flexibility, but the vertebrae are held tightly in place by numerous supporting ligaments that provide strength and stability.</p>
                <p>The main features of a typical vertebra are the tubular body and the posterior arch that surrounds and protects the spinal cord. The arch is composed of pedicles that arise from the vertebral body and lamina that join at the midline. Each vertebra has seven processes: three serve as attachment sites for muscles, and four serve as articular surfaces for adjacent vertebrae. The two transverse processes arise from the arch, where the pedicles and laminae meet. One spinous process emerges from the middle of the posterior arch.</p>
                <p>Two types of joints support the articulation of adjacent vertebrae. The flat surfaces of the vertebral bodies join through a secondary cartilaginous joint, or symphysis. The bones themselves are separated by the intervertebral disc, which has an outer fibrous layer, the anulus fibrosus, that surrounds a soft inner layer, the nucleus pulposus. The disc provides support for the joint but also provides flexibility and a cushion against the weight of the upper body. Secondary support is provided by the four articular processes. These processes also emerge from the posterior arch. Two are directed superiorly and two inferiorly. The superior and inferior processes of adjacent vertebrae join to form a zygapophyseal joint. This synovial joint provides strength with a limited amount of flexibility.</p>
                <p>The pedicle and superior articular process together form a notch that is complemented by a second notch formed by the pedicle and inferior process. When two vertebrae are in apposition, the superior and inferior notches form the intervertebral foramen. This space is where spinal nerves emerge from the spinal cord to supply peripheral structures.</p>
                <p>Peripheral nerve fibers arising from the spinal cord as anterior (ventral) roots are primarily motor, whereas the posterior (dorsal) roots are primarily sensory. These roots join to form the spinal nerve. In the cervical spine, the roots travel laterally to leave the vertebral column. The spinal nerve splits to form two mixed-function branches, a small posterior primary ramus and a larger anterior primary ramus. Nerves emerging from lower levels of spinal cord course inferiorly before they exit. This is because the cord itself stops at about vertebral level L1. Therefore the roots must travel nearly straight inferiorly before forming the spinal nerves of the lower lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal regions. As these numerous roots stream inferiorly, they form the cauda equina.</p>
                <p>The symphysis between vertebral bodies is normally very strong because the intervertebral disc is reinforced by anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments. However, in some people, these ligaments weaken, and the intervertebral disc pushes through. If so, the roots may be compressed by the nucleus pulposus through the weakened anulus. The most common result is stimulation of pain fibers in posterior roots. More serious cases may result in paresthesia (area of localized numbness), but rarely is motor function disrupted. Although the actual site of injury is proximal, the brain perceives the information as coming from the region of the body innervated by the compressed root. Thus, with lumbar herniations, the distribution of this type of pain (radicular pain) tends to follow the dermatomes of the lower extremity. These areas progress on the anterior surface from L1 in the inguinal region to L4 at the knee and medial leg and to L5 along the lateral leg. On the posterior surface, S1 is lateral on the thigh and leg, and S2 is medial. S3 through S5 are perianal. Sensory fibers from a given spinal level spread into adjacent dermatomes. Therefore, in order to achieve complete numbness of a single dermatome, three adjacent spinal nerves must be anesthetized.</p>
                <p>In this case, the patient experienced pain when, in the supine position, his straightened leg was raised. This sign indicates that slight mechanical stretching of the sciatic nerve is sufficient to enhance the effect of the herniated disc. Dorsiflexion of the foot exacerbates the pain. In some patients, straightening the contralateral leg may also cause pain in the affected leg, thus confirming radiculopathy.</p>
                <p>Radiographic imaging can be used to confirm the herniation. Currently, the best modality is MRI because the herniation can be observed directly and MRI is a noninvasive procedure. With the widespread use of MRI, it has become clear that many herniated discs are asymptomatic. An older technique, myelography, is also used on occasion. This technique takes advantage of the fact that the dura mater covers the spinal roots and proximal spinal nerve. Injection of contrast medium into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will infiltrate to the spinal nerves. Therefore, compressed nerve sheaths will not be filled by the dye, and the herniated disc can be observed indirectly.</p>

                <h3>33.2 Clinical Case: Prolapsed Lumbar Nucleus Pulposus</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 54-year-old man complains of lower back pain that radiates down the back of his right leg. He states that the pain is worsened by coughing or lifting but relieved by lying down. He denies trauma to his back. On examination, the strength and sensation of his lower extremities are normal. During the examination, while the patient is lying on his back (supine), the patient complains of severe pain when his right leg is raised by the clinician.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Herniated lumbar disc (prolapsed lumbar nucleus pulposus).</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical mechanism for this condition:</strong> The ruptured intervertebral disc impinges on the nerve root as it exits from the vertebral canal.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 54-year-old man has lower back pain that radiates down the back of his right leg, is exacerbated by intra-abdominal pressure (Valsalva), and is relieved by rest. He denies trauma. The neurological evaluation is normal, but his pain is elicited by raising a straightened right leg.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This patient experiences pain radiating down the back of his leg in the distribution served by the sciatic nerve. Hence, the syndrome is referred to as sciatica. The pain is caused by impingement of the nerve roots contributing to the sciatic nerve (L4 through S3). He has no history of trauma, and we do not have details of his occupation. Heavy lifting is often an associated factor. The pain is worsened by increased intra-abdominal pressure (Valsalva maneuver); thus, coughing and straining often exacerbate the symptoms. The straight leg raising maneuver elicits pain. Because this patient does not have neurological deficits, conservative therapy would include rest, physical therapy, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Most patients improve with this treatment. Lack of improvement, neurological deficits, or history of trauma or malignancy usually necessitates imaging of the spine. MRI is considered to be the most accurate means of examining this region.</p>

                <p>Peripheral nerve fibers arise from the spinal cord as anterior (ventral) roots, which are primarily motor, and posterior (dorsal) roots, which are primarily sensory. These roots join to form the spinal nerve. The spinal nerve splits to form two mixed function branches, a small posterior primary ramus and a larger anterior primary ramus. In the abdomen, the posterior primary ramus innervates the intrinsic muscles of the back and the overlying skin. The anterior primary ramus projects anteriorly and inferiorly to innervate the muscles of the abdominal wall and the overlying skin.</p>
                <p>After infecting the skin, the varicella virus is transported within the axons of sensory neurons back to the cell bodies, which are located in the posterior root ganglia. The virus periodically reactivates and is transported back out along the distribution of the spinal nerve that is carrying the sensory axons. Thus skin eruptions occur along the dermatomal distribution of the spinal nerve. In the thorax, the main dermatomal landmarks are the clavicle (C5) and nipple (T4). In the abdomen, the major dermatomal landmarks are the xiphoid process of the sternum (T7), umbilicus (T10), and inguinal/suprapubic region (L1).</p>

                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 68-year-old man has severe dysesthesia on his right waist for 2-day duration and, more recently, an erythematous vesicular (blister-like) rash.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This 68-year-old man has clinical symptoms consistent with herpes zoster, also known as shingles. The chicken pox virus remains latent and may become reactivated years later due to illness, stress, or age. The varicella virus is reactivated from the dorsal root ganglia and initially causes a burning pain that follows the distribution of a dermatome, most commonly T3 through L3. Usually 2 to 3 days after the pain, a rash erupts that is erythematous and vesicular, and has a reddish blister-like appearance. Treatment of this condition may include corticosteroid therapy, which can help to decrease the inflammation and pain. Even after the skin lesions have healed, the patient can have significant pain, called postherpetic neuralgia. The pain can persist for months or even years. Treatment of postherpetic neuralgia is difficult, and therapies include topical lidocaine gel, capsaicin cream, anticonvulsant agents, or even nerve blocks.</p>

                <p>Within the cranial cavity, the brain is protected by three meningeal layers. The dura mater, a thick fibrous membrane, is the most superficial. Apposed to the deep surface of the dura mater is the arachnoid mater, which is a delicate thin membrane that is nearly transparent. The pia mater is the thinnest layer, and it is directly apposed to the surface of the brain. Three spaces relate to the three layers. The epidural space lies between the periosteum of the calvaria and the dura mater. Normally, the dura is closely apposed to the bone, so this is a potential space that can be expanded by blood or pus. Similarly, the arachnoid mater is closely apposed to the dura mater. The subdural space between the two layers is also a potential space. The subarachnoid space lies between the arachnoid and pia mater. This space is normally filled with CSF, which is the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system. CSF pooled in the subarachnoid space also serves a protective function by helping to insulate the brain and spinal cord from mechanical shocks.</p>
                <p>CSF in the subarachnoid space is produced by the choroid plexus, in the ependyma of the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. CSF produced in the lateral ventricles flows through the interventricular foramina of Monro into the third ventricle. The cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius then conducts CSF into the fourth ventricle. From there, fluid flows through the foramina of Magendie and Luschka into the subarachnoid space, where it surrounds the brain and spinal cord. The circulatory path ends at the arachnoid granulations, where CSF is resorbed back into the venous system. Most arachnoid granulations are found lining the large venous sinuses, but arachnoid villi may also be present at the roots of spinal nerves.</p>
                <p>Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, but in practice the term refers to infections of the pia and arachnoid layers, usually involving the CSF. Infections reach the meninges by several routes. Most infections seem to be transferred through the vasculature (hematogenous transmission). On the arterial side, bacteria can infiltrate through the choroid plexus into the CSF. On the venous side, there are several routes from the face into the cranium. Normally, the veins drain superficially and inferiorly through the pterygoid venous plexus and facial and retromandibular veins. However, there are also anastomoses with the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins. These veins carry blood from the orbit into the cavernous sinus, which is in the anterior cranial fossa. Because veins in the face have no valves, some infections can reverse the normal flow of blood, so that pathogens are carried into the cavernous sinus. They can then infiltrate through the walls of the sinus into the CSF. A second route is through the nasopharynx. Mucosal infections can track through the cribriform plate into the anterior cranial fossa.</p>
                <p>The severe headaches associated with meningitis are due to increased intracranial pressure, which stretches the dura and stimulates pain fibers from cranial nerve V3 (mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve) traveling with branches of the middle meningeal artery.</p>

                <h3>35.2 Clinical Case: Meningitis</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 7-year-old boy is brought into the emergency room for severe headache, nausea, and fever. His parent states that the patient had been in good health until 2 days previously. Bright lights seem to bother him. On examination, he appears lethargic and ill. His temperature is 102°F. Movement of the neck seems to cause some pain. The heart and lung examinations are normal. The patient refuses to flex his head so that his chin will touch his chest because the effort is too painful.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Meningitis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Most likely anatomical mechanism:</strong> Migration of bacteria through the nasopharynx or through the choroid plexus.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 7-year-old boy has a 2-day history of severe headache, nausea, fever, and photophobia. He appears lethargic and ill. His temperature is 102°F, and he has some nuchal rigidity.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This young child has a 2-day history of fever, headache, nausea, and photophobia. His general appearance is that of sepsis. The nuchal rigidity is suggestive of meningitis. These symptoms are caused by cerebral inflammation, ischemia, and edema. Increased intracranial pressure may cause lethargy and even seizures. The most common causative organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Previously, Haemophilus influenzae was the most commonly isolated organism, but, with the advent of the H. influenzae vaccine, this pathogen has been less of a factor. The diagnosis is made by lumbar puncture. Positive findings would be leukocytes (in particular neutrophils) isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and gram-positive organisms. A diffuse erythematous maculopapular rash that becomes petechial is suggestive of meningococcus. Rapid initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy is critical; the medication is aimed at the most common causative organisms and must penetrate through the blood-brain barrier.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>The thyroid gland is located at the base of the neck, consisting of left and right lobes connected by a narrow isthmus. During development, the gland forms at the base of the tongue at the foramen cecum and descends into the neck along the thyroglossal duct, reaching its final position inferior to the cricoid cartilage (vertebral levels C5 through T1). Occasionally, ectopic thyroid tissue deposits along the duct, sometimes manifesting as a pyramidal lobe arising from the midline along the remnants of the duct.</p>
                <p>As an endocrine gland, the thyroid receives a rich vascular supply. The superior thyroid artery, the first anterior branch of the external carotid artery, descends laterally to the hyoid bone, giving off the superior laryngeal artery, which pierces the thyrohyoid membrane. It continues toward the gland lateral to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, crossing along the superior border of the thyroid and usually anastomosing with the contralateral superior thyroid artery. The inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk from the first part of the subclavian artery, ascends, giving off an ascending cervical artery, then curves inferiorly to enter the thyroid gland from the posterior surface. There are many anastomoses between branches of the superior and inferior thyroid arteries. Rarely, a thyroidea ima artery arises directly from the brachiocephalic trunk or the aortic arch to supply the thyroid. The gland is drained by three pairs of veins: the superior and middle thyroid veins drain to the internal jugulars, and the inferior thyroid veins drain to the brachiocephalics.</p>
                <p>The thyroid lies anterior to the trachea, a hollow tube that conducts air to the lungs, formed from the inferior pharynx anterior to the esophagus. The tracheal wall is supported by C-shaped cartilaginous rings, leaving the posterior wall flexible for esophageal expansion during swallowing. Superior to the thyroid gland are the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, specialized structures protecting the larynx.</p>
                <p>The larynx modulates expelled air for speech and protects the airway from food and drink. It is formed from the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, epiglottis, and arytenoid cartilages. The thyroid cartilage, the largest tracheal ring, forms the laryngeal prominence (“Adam’s apple”). The cricoid cartilage, inferior to the thyroid cartilage, is the only closed tracheal ring. The epiglottis, bound by the thyroepiglottic ligament, attaches to the arytenoid cartilages via the quadrangular membrane, forming the aryepiglottic fold and vestibular ligament (false vocal fold). The conus elasticus, fusing the lateral and median cricothyroid ligaments, forms the vocal ligament (true vocal fold). The space between the vocal folds is the rima glottidis, which controls airflow.</p>
                <p>Intrinsic laryngeal muscles control the vocal folds. The posterior cricoarytenoids abduct the vocal folds for breathing. Other muscles (lateral cricoarytenoids, transverse and oblique arytenoids, cricothyroid, thyroarytenoid, vocalis) adduct or modulate vocal fold tension. The epiglottis and suprahyoid muscles protect the airway during swallowing. Most intrinsic laryngeal muscles are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (vagus nerve, CN X), except the cricothyroid, innervated by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. Sensory innervation above the vocal folds is via the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, and below via the recurrent laryngeal nerve.</p>

                <h3>36.2 Clinical Case: Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injury</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 35-year-old woman complains of a 2-month history of hoarseness of her voice and some choking while drinking liquids. She denies viral illnesses. She underwent surgery for a cold nodule of the thyroid gland 9 weeks ago. Her only medication is acetaminophen with codeine.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical explanation for her symptoms:</strong> Vocal cord paralysis.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 35-year-old woman has a 2-month history of voice hoarseness and choking after undergoing surgery for a cold (nonfunctioning) thyroid nodule.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This woman underwent surgery for a thyroid nodule, defined as a mass that does not take up radioactive iodine isotope. Surgery of the thyroid gland can injure the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which runs through the posterior superior suspensory ligament of the thyroid gland. This nerve provides motor innervation to the larynx and sensory innervation to the laryngeal mucosa. Traction injury or severing of the nerve leads to vocal cord paralysis, causing the vocal cord to bow into a paramedian position, resulting in hoarseness and potential choking if liquid is aspirated into the trachea. If vocal cord function does not return after 6 months to 1 year, injection of the affected vocal cord with Teflon can be helpful. Inadvertent excision of the parathyroid glands within the thyroid tissue can lead to hypocalcemia, causing fatigue, dyspnea, brittle skin and nails, tetanic muscle contractions, seizures, or difficulty swallowing.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Which of the following muscles is most important to allow air movement through the larynx?
                        <ol type="A">
                            <li>Posterior cricoarytenoids</li>
                            <li>Lateral cricoarytenoids</li>
                            <li>Cricothyroid muscle</li>
                            <li>Infrahyoid muscles</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A. The posterior cricoarytenoid muscles are the only muscles that abduct the vocal folds and are necessary to widen the rima glottidis for breathing.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>A 33-year-old woman underwent partial thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism in which the thyroid failed to take up radioactive iodine. She is noted to have some hoarseness of voice 1 month later. Which of the following is the most likely explanation?
                        <ol type="A">
                            <li>Endotracheal tube trauma to the vocal cords</li>
                            <li>Injury to the cricoid cartilage</li>
                            <li>Injury to the thyroid cartilage</li>
                            <li>Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> D. Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve is common during thyroid surgery and may lead to the inability to tightly adduct the two vocal folds, resulting in hoarseness. In addition, the protective function of the rima glottidis may be lost, and food or liquid that does not go down the esophagus may flow into the trachea and cause a choking response.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>A 15-year-old boy is eating a fish dinner and inadvertently has a bone “caught in his throat.” He complains of significant pain above the vocal cords. Which of the following nerves is responsible for carrying the sensation for this pain?
                        <ol type="A">
                            <li>Superior laryngeal nerve</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A. The laryngeal mucosa above the vocal cords is innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve, whereas mucosa below the vocal cords is innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>A 25-year-old woman underwent surgery for a thyroid nodule. Two months later, she complains of dryness of skin and muscle spasms. Which of the following is the most likely explanation?

                <ul>
                    <li>Review the somatotopic organization of sensory and motor regions in the brain.</li>
                    <li>List the branches of the common carotid artery and the vascular supply to the brain and identify the sites most susceptible to formation of atherosclerotic plaques.</li>
                    <li>Describe structures in the anterior triangle of the neck that relate to the carotid artery and sheath.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Auscultation:</strong> Procedure of listening to the body during the physical examination, generally through a stethoscope.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bruits:</strong> An abnormal sound heard through the stethoscope, generally a “whoosh.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Somatotopic:</strong> An orderly mapping of the body surface onto an internal organ, usually a region of the brain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ansa cervicalis:</strong> A loop formed superficially in the carotid sheath by branches of cervical spinal nerves innervating the strap muscles.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The brain’s major structures include the cerebrum and cerebellum. The cerebrum handles sensory perception, motor control, and associational processing, while the cerebellum is primarily involved in motor control. The cerebral cortex is folded into gyri separated by sulci, divided into frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. The central sulcus separates the frontal from the parietal lobes, with the precentral gyrus controlling voluntary motion and the postcentral gyrus handling somatosensory perception.</p>
                <p>The sensory and motor areas are somatotopically organized: the lower extremity is medial, the upper extremity more lateral, and the head and neck most lateral. Tracts to and from these areas cross in the lower brain and spinal cord, controlling the opposite side of the body. The motor speech area (Broca area) is in the anterior parietal cortex of the left brain, superior to the temporal lobe.</p>
                <p>The brain’s blood supply comes from the common carotid and vertebral arteries. The vertebral artery ascends through the cervical vertebrae’s transverse foramina, enters the cranium via the foramen magnum, and forms the basilar artery. The common carotid bifurcates at the hyoid bone (C3–C4) into the external carotid, supplying extracranial structures, and the internal carotid, which enters the cranium through the carotid canal. The circle of Willis, formed by the basilar artery’s bifurcation into posterior cerebral arteries and the internal carotids’ bifurcation into anterior and middle cerebral arteries, facilitates anastomosis.</p>
                <p>The carotids are susceptible to atherosclerotic occlusion, particularly at the bifurcation of the internal and external carotids and the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Emboli from plaques often affect the middle cerebral artery, causing deficits in movement, sensation, and language.</p>
                <p>The carotid arteries are palpated in the anterior triangle of the neck, divided by the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) into anterior and posterior triangles. The anterior triangle includes the submental, submandibular, muscular, and carotid triangles. The common carotid ascends deep to the muscular triangle’s contents (sternothyroid, sternohyoid, omohyoid) and through the carotid triangle. The carotid sheath contains the common and internal carotid arteries, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve, and the ansa cervicalis.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 59-year-old man who has hypertension complains of numbness of his right arm and slurred speech for a 4-hour duration. He has carotid bruits bilaterally.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This patient’s symptoms suggest ischemia of the left cerebral hemisphere, including the speech area. If resolved within 24 hours, it is a transient ischemic attack; if persistent, it is a stroke. Ischemic strokes, caused by atherosclerosis or emboli, are indicated by carotid bruits due to turbulent flow through stenotic vessels. Management includes antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel) and a CT scan to differentiate ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke. Carotid endarterectomy may be indicated post-stabilization.</p>

                <p>The sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) is a key surface landmark, dividing the anterior neck into anterior and posterior triangles. Superiorly, it attaches to the mastoid process of the temporal bone; inferiorly, it splits to attach to the manubrium of the sternum and the clavicle. Contraction of the SCM rotates the head to the opposite side and causes lateral flexion. Co-contraction of both SCMs contributes to straight neck flexion. The SCM is innervated by the spinal accessory nerve (CN XI), which also innervates the trapezius.</p>
                <p>Other landmarks include the laryngeal prominence (thyroid cartilage), external jugular vein (crossing the SCM to drain into the internal jugular), and platysma muscle folds.

                <h3>38.2 Clinical Case: Torticollis</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 3-month-old girl is noted by the pediatrician to have a stiff neck for a 2-month duration. The mother states that the neck seems to be pulled to the right. On examination, the baby’s right ear is tilted toward her right side, but the baby’s face is turned toward the left. Palpation of the neck reveals a nontender mass of the right anterior neck region.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Torticollis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical structure affected:</strong> Sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 3-month-old girl’s head is flexed to the right and rotated to the left. Palpation reveals a nontender mass in the right anterior neck region.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Torticollis, observed in 3–5 per 1000 births, is due to fibrosis of the SCM, causing muscle shortening. A palpable mass (about olive-sized) is present in 66% of cases. It may be associated with breech births or difficult deliveries, leading to lateral head flexion and contralateral rotation. Physical therapy is effective in most cases, with surgery rarely needed.</p>

                <p>The lymphatic system complements the venous system, returning serum constituents to the heart. Lymphatic vessels form from tissue plexuses, interrupted by lymph nodes containing white blood cells. Lymphatics from below the diaphragm drain into the cisterna chyli and then the thoracic duct, which ascends in the posterior mediastinum to drain into the venous system at the junction of the left subclavian and internal jugular veins. Above the diaphragm, left-side lymphatics drain into the thoracic duct, while right-side lymphatics drain into the right lymphatic duct, which empties into the right subclavian vein.</p>
                <p>In the neck, lymphatic flow is from superficial to deep, paralleling major veins. Superficial and deep lymph node clusters drain from superior to inferior. The inferior deep group, along the internal jugular and subclavian veins, also drains the upper extremity, thorax, and abdomen. Supraclavicular nodes are sentinel nodes, often enlarging first in cancers from the thorax or abdomen due to lymphatic spread.</p>

                    <li><strong>Chorda tympani:</strong> Small branch of the facial nerve that supplies taste receptors in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Upper motor neuron:</strong> Neurons that conduct information from motor areas of the brain to the spinal cord. The lower motor neurons project from gray matter in the spinal cord to peripheral muscle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vidian nerve:</strong> Nerve of the pterygoid canal.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The facial nerve (CN VII) originates from the lateral surface of the caudal pons at the cerebellopontine junction, with a large branchiomeric motor root and a smaller nervus intermedius containing sensory and visceral motor fibers. It enters the internal acoustic meatus with the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII), occupying the anterosuperior quadrant. The nerve bends posteriorly at the genu within the facial canal, where the greater petrosal nerve and geniculate ganglion arise. It passes through the facial canal, inferior to the lateral semicircular canal, and gives off branches to the stapedius muscle and chorda tympani before exiting via the stylomastoid foramen.</p>
                <p>The facial nerve courses through the parotid gland, splitting into temporal, zygomatic, buccal, mandibular, and cervical branches, plus a posterior auricular branch. The greater petrosal nerve courses anteriorly to the pterygopalatine fossa, merging with the deep petrosal nerve to form the Vidian nerve, which synapses in the pterygopalatine ganglion to innervate glands. The chorda tympani supplies taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and parasympathetic fibers to the submandibular and sublingual glands.</p>
                <p>The facial nerve’s functions include motor innervation to facial expression muscles, stapedius, stylohyoid, and posterior digastric; visceral motor innervation to lacrimal, submandibular, sublingual, and mucosal glands; and sensory innervation for taste (anterior two-thirds of the tongue) and a small patch of auricular skin.</p>

                    <li>A 44-year-old man complains of difficulty hearing from the right ear and headaches. He also has weakness of the facial muscles. Which of the following is the most likely explanation?
                        <ol type="A">
                            <li>Peripheral CN VII palsy</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C. When multiple nerves are affected, it is unlikely to be a peripheral disorder. Cranial nerves VII and VIII exit in close proximity from the pons. A schwannoma involving the cerebellopontine angle can affect both cranial nerves.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>An injury to the facial nerve (CN VII) as it leaves the stylomastoid foramen would disrupt which function?

                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> E. Wrinkling the forehead is produced by contraction of the frontalis muscle, which is innervated by the facial nerve. The facial nerve is responsible for taste in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, but the chorda tympani emerges before the main trunk exits through the stylomastoid foramen.

                </ul>
                <p>The trigeminal nerve (CN V) exits the brain from the lateral surface of the pons. The sensory fibers arise as a large root, while motor fibers to the muscles of mastication usually arise as a separate smaller root. The nerve courses on the lateral surface of the sphenoid bone deep to the cavernous sinus. The cell bodies of the sensory nerves form the trigeminal ganglion along the medial wall of the middle cranial fossa. Three large nerves emerge from the ganglion: the ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3) divisions.</p>
                <p>Branches of these nerves supply general sensation to the face and anterior scalp, while the posterior scalp is supplied by cervical spinal nerves. The ophthalmic nerve supplies the dermatome superior to the horizontal midline of the orbit and the midline region of the nose. The maxillary nerve supplies the region over the maxilla, inferior to the orbit, including the lateral surface of the nose and the upper lip, with a small band extending superiorly over the zygomatic arch and temporalis muscle. The mandibular division supplies a band of skin running superiorly over the temporalis muscle.</p>
                <p>The major branches of the ophthalmic nerve supplying the skin are the supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves (forehead and anterior scalp) and the nasociliary nerve (medial nose via the external nasal branch of the anterior ethmoidal nerve). The maxillary nerve innervates the skin primarily through the infraorbital nerve, with contributions from the zygomaticofacial and zygomaticotemporal nerves. The mandibular nerve’s branches include the auriculotemporal nerve (superiorly), mental nerve (inferiorly, a branch of the inferior alveolar), and buccal nerve (cheek skin and buccal mucosa, but not motor innervation to the buccinator, which is supplied by CN VII).</p>

                <p>A 35-year-old woman complains of spasms of excruciating pain of the right cheek and chin. These pain episodes last for a few seconds and are intense. She had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 2 years previously. She is not taking medications currently, although she previously received intravenous corticosteroid therapy. Her physician says that her problem is related to the nerve that innervates the skin of the cheek area.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 35-year-old woman who has multiple sclerosis complains of excruciating spasms of pain that affect her right cheek and chin and last for a few seconds.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) is among the most excruciating types of pain, causing patients to wince. This woman’s history of multiple sclerosis is significant, as trigeminal neuralgia is relatively common in this group. The pain’s character excludes migraine (throbbing unilateral pain with orbital involvement) or tension headache (band-like constricting pain). She has no history of herpes simplex virus, which can affect CN V. CN V has three sensory branches. Treatment includes carbamazepine or baclofen and, in severe cases, trigeminal nerve ablation.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>The extraocular muscles of the orbit include the levator palpebrae superioris, four rectus muscles (superior, inferior, lateral, and medial), and two oblique muscles (superior and inferior). All originate from the apex of the pyramidal orbit near the optic canal, except the inferior oblique, which arises from the anterior orbital floor. All but the levator palpebrae superioris attach to the eyeball, controlling its movement. Their attachments, actions, and innervation are detailed in Table 42-1.</p>

                <p>The levator palpebrae superioris elevates the upper eyelid, attaching to the skin and tarsal plate, opposed by the orbicularis oculi. It contains smooth muscle fibers (superior tarsal muscle) innervated by sympathetic nerves. The superior oblique passes through the trochlea, a pulley at the superior-medial orbit, inserting on the posterosuperior sclera, turning the pupil down and out. The inferior oblique inserts on the posteroinferior sclera, turning the pupil up and out. The rectus muscles originate from a common tendinous ring, inserting on the anterior sclera, with superior and inferior recti also adducting and rotating the eyeball medially.</p>
                <p>For testing, the superior and inferior recti are assessed with the eyeball abducted, aligning their pull for elevation and depression. The superior and inferior obliques are tested with the eyeball adducted, aligning their pull for depression and elevation. The lateral and medial recti are tested by abducting or adducting the eyeball. Oculomotor nerve (CN III) injury results in a pupil turned down and out, dilated, with ptosis. Trochlear nerve (CN IV) injury causes slight adduction, weak downward gaze, and head tilting. Abducens nerve (CN VI) injury results in an adducted eye.</p>

                <p>A 38-year-old male presents to the emergency room with complaints of a persistent headache and problems with his left eye. He has no known medical problems, and his headache is slightly improved with ibuprofen. He denies having any previous problems with his vision. On exam, he is noted to have a left eye with ptosis, dilated pupil, and displacement “down and out.” The remainder of the exam is normal. An MRI shows an aneurysm of the circle of Willis.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 38-year-old healthy male with new onset left eye findings of ptosis, dilated pupil, and displacement of eye “down and out.”</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Ptosis, dilated pupil, and eye displacement “down and out” indicate oculomotor nerve palsy. The oculomotor nerve (CN III), originating from the midbrain, controls most eye movements, pupil constriction, and eyelid elevation. The unopposed action of the lateral rectus (CN VI) and superior oblique (CN IV) causes the “down and out” position. Causes include aneurysm, compression, infection, infarction, or tumor.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>During a physical examination of a patient, you notice ptosis of the patient’s left eye. This would indicate to you there is paralysis of which muscle?
                        <ol type="A">
                            <li>Orbicularis muscle</li>
                            <li>Superior oblique muscle</li>
                            <li>Inferior oblique muscle</li>
                            <li>Inferior rectus muscle</li>
                            <li>Levator palpebrae muscle</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> E. Ptosis or drooping of the eyelid is due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae muscle. The orbicularis muscle closes the eyelid.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>While performing a physical examination, you test the function of the muscles attached to the eyeball, and thereby the integrity of their innervation. You would test the function of the superior oblique muscle by having the patient do which of the following?
                        <ol type="A">
                            <li>Look in toward the nose</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> D. Turning the eyeball inward places the superior oblique’s axis in line with its pull, depressing the pupil.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>During this same physical exam, you ask the patient to look laterally with her right eye, and then upward. You have just tested the function of which muscle?

                <p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Define the layers of the scalp.</li>
                    <li>Describe the structure of cranial sutures.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Major sutures of the skull:</strong> The sagittal suture runs along the midline between the parietal bones. The lambdoidal suture separates the parietal bones from the occipital bone posteriorly. The coronal suture separates the frontal bone from the parietal bones anteriorly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hematoma:</strong> Pool of blood that accumulates in a tissue or space, usually clotted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bilirubin:</strong> Bile salt formed from hemoglobin breakdown by the liver, causing jaundice at high blood levels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Icteric:</strong> Yellowish appearance of jaundice, here due to bilirubin breakdown in the hematoma.</li>
                    <li><strong>Caput succedaneum:</strong> Edematous swelling of the superficial scalp due to birth trauma, resolving within 2–3 days.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The scalp covers the calvaria, consisting of five layers remembered by the mnemonic SCALP: Skin, Connective tissue (dense), Aponeurosis (galea aponeurotica), Loose connective tissue, and Periosteum. The skin, dense connective tissue, and aponeurosis move together, while the loose connective tissue allows superficial layers to slide over the periosteum, which adheres tightly to the bone, especially at sutures in infants.</p>
                <p>The scalp’s blood supply comes from the internal carotid (supraorbital and supratrochlear arteries) and external carotid (superficial temporal, occipital, and posterior auricular arteries), with extensive anastomoses. Sensory innervation anteriorly is via CN V (supraorbital, supratrochlear, auriculotemporal nerves), and posteriorly by cervical spinal nerves (C2: greater occipital; C3; lesser occipital, posterior auricular from cervical plexus).</p>
                <p>Trauma can cause hematomas. Superficial fascia hematomas spread slowly due to septa, while subperiosteal hematomas in infants are contained by sutures, as seen in cephalohematomas from suction-assisted delivery. In adults, the loose connective layer is a “danger space” for infection spread to the periorbital space and cranium via the cavernous sinus.</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A male infant who weighs 3500 g appears icteric on examination. The previous day, the infant was delivered vaginally by vacuum-assisted extraction because there were severe fetal heart rate decelerations. The infant’s scalp has a 5-cm discolored soft tissue swelling that seems to be contained by and does not cross the sagittal or lambdoidal sutures. The mother had no prenatal or medical problems. There is no family history of bleeding disorders.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Cephalohematoma.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical mechanism for the condition:</strong> Injury to the branches of arteries supplying the lateral skull.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 1-day-old male infant, delivered by vacuum-assisted extraction, appears icteric with a 5-cm scalp hematoma contained within the sagittal and lambdoidal sutures.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> The infant’s icterus and suture-contained soft tissue mass indicate a cephalohematoma, distinct from caput succedaneum, which crosses sutures. Hemoglobin in the hematoma breaks down into bilirubin, causing icterus. Vacuum extraction likely injured periosteal arteries, leading to subperiosteal bleeding. A skull radiograph or CT scan assesses for fractures. Most cephalohematomas resolve with observation.</p>

                    <li><strong>Pachymeninx:</strong> The thick meningeal layer, i.e., the dura mater.</li>
                    <li><strong>Leptomeninx:</strong> The thin meningeal layers, i.e., the arachnoid and pia maters together.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dural sinus:</strong> Cavity filled with venous blood formed by a split in the dura mater’s periosteal and meningeal layers, draining into the internal jugular vein.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pterion:</strong> A landmark where the frontal, parietal, temporal, and sphenoid bones converge, often H-shaped.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The brain is covered by three meningeal layers: dura mater (pachymeninx), arachnoid mater, and pia mater (leptomeninges). The dura mater, a thick membrane, adheres to the cranium’s deep surface. The arachnoid mater, a thin layer, adheres to the dura, separated from the brain by the subarachnoid space containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The pia mater adheres to the brain’s surface.</p>
                <p>The dura mater has two layers: an external periosteal layer attached to bone and an internal meningeal layer forming folds. The falx cerebri separates cerebral hemispheres, the tentorium cerebelli separates cerebrum from cerebellum, and the falx cerebelli partially separates cerebellar lobes. The diaphragma sellae covers the pituitary fossa. Dural sinuses form where the layers split, including the superior sagittal sinus (along falx cerebri), transverse sinus (along tentorium cerebelli), and others, draining into the internal jugular vein.</p>
                <p>The dura is supplied by the middle meningeal artery, arising from the maxillary artery, entering via the foramen spinosum, and running within the dura near the pterion. The brain is supplied by the circle of Willis, formed by internal carotid and vertebral arteries. Trauma can cause hematomas: epidural (middle meningeal artery rupture, between dura and cranium), subarachnoid (cerebral artery rupture), or subdural (venous rupture, between dura and arachnoid).</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 15-year-old boy was the pitcher for his little league baseball team when he was hit by a line drive to the right temple area. He lost consciousness briefly but woke up after about 45 seconds and had no neurological deficits. He was taken to the emergency room and seemed to be in good condition. Four hours later, while being observed, he complained of an increasing headache and had a seizure. On examination, the patient’s right pupil appeared dilated and reacted sluggishly to light. The emergency physician is concerned about increased intracranial pressure.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Epidural hematoma resulting in increased intracranial pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical explanation for this condition:</strong> Disruption of a branch of the middle meningeal artery, causing a growing hematoma between the dura and cranium, putting pressure on the brain.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 15-year-old boy was hit by a baseball to the right temple, briefly lost consciousness, had a lucid interval, and later developed headache, seizure, and a dilated, sluggish right pupil, indicating increased intracranial pressure.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> The boy’s trauma likely disrupted the middle meningeal artery under the temporal bone, causing an epidural hematoma. The lucid interval followed by deterioration is typical, as arterial bleeding rapidly expands the hematoma, compressing the brain and CN III, affecting the ipsilateral pupil. Emergent decompression and surgical control of bleeding are critical.</p>

The sublingual gland lies in the floor of the mouth between the mandible and genioglossus muscle.</p>
                <p>The parotid duct crosses the masseter muscle, pierces the buccinator, and opens into the oral cavity at the second upper molar. The submandibular duct arises from the gland’s deep lobe, runs anteriorly on the hyoglossus muscle, and opens via submandibular caruncles lateral to the lingual frenulum. The sublingual gland has multiple small ducts emptying at the tongue’s base.</p>
                <p>The submandibular duct is related to the mylohyoid, hyoglossus, and sublingual gland. The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) courses inferior to the duct, and the lingual nerve loops underneath it before innervating the tongue.</p>

                <h3>45.2 Clinical Case: Salivary Stone</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 36-year-old woman complains of pain and swelling beneath the left mandible, particularly after eating a meal. On examination, she is noted to have edema and tenderness of the left submandibular region. Palpation of her mouth reveals a 4-mm, irregular, nonmobile, hard mass in the mucosa of her mouth. She denies trauma to the region and does not have an eating disorder.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Stone in the submandibular duct (sialolithiasis).</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical course of the affected structure:</strong> The submandibular salivary duct drains from the deep lobe of the submandibular gland and courses anterolaterally along the base of the tongue. Occlusion by a stone causes saliva to accumulate proximally, causing distention and pain.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 36-year-old woman has pain and swelling of the left submandibular area, with tenderness and a 4-mm irregular mass along the floor of her mouth. She denies trauma or eating disorders.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> The woman’s post-meal pain and submandibular swelling suggest a stone in the submandibular duct. Saliva accumulation proximal to the occlusion causes duct or gland capsule stretching. Swelling may indicate secondary infection. Sialolithiasis results from a particle (e.g., food, bacteria) serving as a nucleus for material deposition. Sialoendoscopy is diagnostic, with treatment involving stone excision and antibiotics, or gland removal if necessary.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Angiography:</strong> Radiographic technique in which contrast medium is injected into the arterial system. X-ray images may be taken at regular intervals to follow the dye from the arterial supply through the venous drainage. Recent advances in MRI have made it possible to examine blood flow without injection of contrast medium.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aneurysm:</strong> Disruption within the wall of an artery that fills with blood and inflates the muscular coat. The resulting dilation can exert pressure on surrounding structures and ultimately may rupture, leading to a rapid loss of blood pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Syncope:</strong> Episode of fainting; a loss of consciousness not related to sleeping.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The arterial blood supply to the brain is derived from the paired internal carotid and paired vertebral arteries. The internal carotid arteries arise from the bifurcation of the common carotid arteries at about the level of the superior border of the thyroid cartilage. They are described as the direct continuation of the common carotids, have no branches in the neck, and ascend to the base of the skull, where they enter the carotid canal. The internal carotid arteries pass anteriorly and medially through the cavernous sinus to enter the cranial cavity and divide into their terminal branches, the anterior cerebral artery and the middle cerebral artery. The two anterior cerebral arteries join through the anterior communicating branch. The posterior communicating branch joins the middle cerebral with the posterior cerebral arteries.</p>
                <p>The vertebral arteries are the first branches of the subclavian arteries in the root of the neck. They ascend through the transverse foramina of vertebrae C6 to C1, enter the cranial cavity through the foramen magnum, and unite to form the basilar artery near the junction of the pons and medulla. At the superior border of the pons, it divides into the posterior cerebral arteries. The chief intracranial branches of the vertebral arteries are the posterior inferior cerebellar arteries. Before its terminal bifurcation, the chief branches of the basilar artery are the anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, superior cerebellar arteries, and several pontine branches.</p>
                <p>The cerebral arterial circle (of Willis) is the major anastomosis of the cerebral vasculature. This allows for perfusion of the brain even with arterial occlusion of one or more major arteries (such as carotid insufficiency). If the occlusion develops slowly, the anastomotic vessels will expand to compensate. However, the anastomosis may not be able to compensate if the occlusion develops rapidly, as with trauma. Blockage of one cerebral artery will have characteristic effects based on the region of the brain supplied by the vessel. The anterior cerebral artery supplies the medial surface of the cerebrum. The middle cerebral artery supplies the lateral surfaces, and the posterior cerebral artery supplies the inferior surface. The middle cerebral artery is occluded most often, presumably because it follows the same trajectory as the internal carotid.</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 43-year-old man was washing his car when he suddenly complained of a severe headache and then slumped to the ground. His son, who had witnessed the episode, stated that his father grabbed his head with both hands and cried out in pain as he was falling. The son said that his father had no medical problems and exercised regularly. On examination in the emergency department, the patient was lethargic but responsive to deep pain stimuli. His pupils were dilated bilaterally and sluggishly reactive to light. CT scan of the head showed a significant intracranial hemorrhage. An angiogram demonstrated leakage of dye from the junction of the right internal carotid artery and the circle of Willis.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Ruptured berry aneurysm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clinical anatomy for this event:</strong> Weakness of the intracranial arterial junction.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> An otherwise healthy 43-year-old man suddenly complained of a severe headache and lost consciousness. He is lethargic, responsive to deep pain, and has bilaterally dilated and sluggishly reactive pupils. CT imaging showed a significant intracranial hemorrhage, and an angiogram demonstrated leakage of dye from the junction of the right internal carotid artery and the circle of Willis.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> This otherwise healthy 43-year-old man had an acute and significant cerebral event. He had a severe headache quickly followed by loss of consciousness. There was no motor activity to suggest an epileptic seizure. Further, his comatose state ruled out self-limited etiologies such as syncope due to a vasovagal reaction. The cerebral imaging confirms intracranial hemorrhage. The possibilities include an arteriovenous malformation (a tangle of vessels that sometimes rupture) or a hemorrhagic stroke. The arteriogram shows leakage of dye from the junction of the internal carotid artery and the circle of Willis, strongly suggesting a berry aneurysm. The blood supply to the brain is derived from the paired internal carotid and the paired vertebral arteries. Occlusion of even one of these vessels would cause severe damage were it not for the anastomosis between these four vessels known as the circle of Willis. However, there is inherent weakness at the junction of the arteries, and an outpouching of the arterial wall, a berry aneurysm, may occur and ultimately rupture. The best treatment for such a ruptured aneurysm is surgical clip ligation. Medications such as calcium channel blockers are useful for preventing coexisting arterial vasospasm.</p>

Within the lumen of the membranous ducts is endolymph, a fluid similar in composition to intracellular fluid (low sodium, high potassium). The space between the ducts and the bony walls is filled with perilymph, a fluid similar in composition to normal extracellular fluid (high sodium, low potassium). The compartments that are filled with perilymph and endolymph do not communicate.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The external ear is composed of the auricle, an elastic cartilage structure covered with skin and having several named parts, one of which is the concha, which funnels sound waves down the external acoustic meatus or canal. The meatus is lined with skin, and the wall of the lateral third is cartilaginous, whereas the medial two-thirds are bony. It has an anteromedial S-shaped course, which can be straightened by posterosuperior traction on the auricle.</p>
                <p>The medial end of the meatus is closed by the tympanic membrane, a somewhat cone-shaped, 1-cm membrane composed of collagen and elastic fibers that is covered externally by thin skin and lined internally by the mucous membrane of the middle ear. The apex of the membrane’s cone is called the umbo. The reflected light of an otoscope, the cone of light, originates at the umbo and is directed anteroinferiorly. A process of the malleus, called the handle, is applied to the medial surface of the membrane, and its tip is also attached at the umbo. The malleus has a lateral process that bulges the superior portion of the membrane laterally. The portion superior to the lateral process is the pars flaccida, and the remainder of the membrane is called the pars tensa.</p>
                <p>The three ear ossicles are the malleus, incus, and stapes, lateral to medial, across the tympanic or middle ear cavity. Each bone has distinctive features. With a normal tympanic membrane, the handle of the malleus is clearly visible, and the long process of the incus is often visible posterior to the malleus. The stapes is shaped much like a stirrup, and its footplate fits into the oval window on the medial wall of the tympanic cavity. Its in-and-out movement transmits pressure waves through the endolymph within the cochlea, where the nerve impulses for hearing are generated. Excessive movements of the ear ossicles with loud noise are dampened by the tensor tympani muscle attached to the malleus and the stapedius muscle attached to the stapes. These muscles are innervated by CN V and CN VII, respectively.</p>
                <p>The tympanic cavity is contained within the petrous portion of the temporal bone. Its features are usually described as being contained within a box with a roof, four walls, and a floor. The tympanic cavity is lined with a mucous membrane and contains the chorda tympani branch of CN VII and the tympanic plexus (CN IX) in addition to the ear ossicles and their associated muscles. Air pressure within the cavity is equalized with the nasopharynx through the pharyngotympanic or auditory tube.</p>

                <h3>47.2 Clinical Case: Middle Ear Effusion</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 12-year-old boy complains of difficulty hearing with his left ear for the past 2 weeks. He states that music and voices seem “far away.” His medical problems include allergic rhinitis and asthma. On examination, he is without fever, but his left ear drum displays a yellowish discoloration. The left drum moves very little with a puff of air. The right tympanic membrane appears normal.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Middle ear effusion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clinical anatomy of the condition:</strong> Middle ear fluid impedes sound transmission by the middle ear ossicles.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 12-year-old boy with allergic rhinitis and asthma has a 2-week history of difficulty hearing with his left ear. He is afebrile but has yellowish discoloration of his left tympanic membrane, which does not move well with insufflation.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Sound waves collected by the auricle and external acoustic meatus (canal) produce vibration of the tympanic membrane. These vibrations are transferred in turn to the ear ossicles, the malleus, incus, and stapes. Vibrations of the stapes produce movements of the endolymph within the cochlea, which are converted to the nervous impulse responsible for the sensation of hearing. Fluid within the middle ear cavity (effusion) diminishes the vibrations of the tympanic membrane and the ear ossicles. Effusions develop in the middle ear secondary to obstruction of the pharyngotympanic (auditory) tube, as with upper respiratory infections or allergic reactions. The insufflation of air through the otoscope in this patient does not induce the normal fluttering of the ear drum, further suggesting an effusion. An infectious process is unlikely in this case because of the absence of a fever or a red ear drum. Treatment of effusions include antihistamines, decongestants, and, in severe cases, surgical incision of the tympanic membrane for drainage (myringotomy) and insertion of drainage tubes.</p>

                    <li>List the openings in the nasal cavity through which the paranasal sinuses drain.</li>

                    <li><strong>Osteomyelitis:</strong> Condition in which the bone and bone marrow become infected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thrombophlebitis:</strong> Condition in which a vein becomes inflamed in response to a blood clot.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The paranasal sinuses are extensions of the nasal cavities into bones of the skull and are named for the bones in which they are located. These spaces are lined with respiratory mucosa, decrease the weight of the skull, and probably assist in humidifying inspired air. The sphenoid sinuses are located within the sphenoid bone, are variable in size and number, and open into the sphenoethmoidal recess. The ethmoidal sinuses consist of a series of sinuses positioned between the medial wall of the orbit and the nasal cavity (at the level of the bridge of the nose). For descriptive purposes, they are divided into anterior, middle, and posterior ethmoidal cells, and each has a separate opening. The posterior ethmoidal cells have their opening in the superior nasal meatus. The middle ethmoidal cells elevate the ethmoid bone in the middle meatus, thus creating the ethmoid bulla on whose surface these cells have their opening. Inferior to the ethmoid bulla is a groove, the semilunar hiatus. The anterior ethmoidal cells open into the anterior portion of the hiatus, called the infundibulum.</p>
                <p>The largest sinuses are the maxillary and frontal sinuses, and their relatively large openings also drain into the middle meatus. The large maxillary sinus hollows the maxillary bone. The roof of the sinus, which also forms the floor of the orbit, is very thin and at risk in direct trauma to the orbit that causes sudden increases in pressure. Such trauma may cause “blow-out” fractures of the orbital floor. The opening of the maxillary sinus is found in the semilunar hiatus. The frontal sinuses are found in the frontal bone between the inner and outer tables and in the portion that forms the roof of the orbit. It is drained by the frontonasal duct, which opens into the infundibulum, the anterior portion of the semilunar hiatus.</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 10-year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician’s office complaining of headache for the past 2 weeks. Her mother had taken the girl to an optometrist, and her vision was normal. The patient states that she has been in good health and that she received a cat as a birthday present 1 month previously. On examination, she has a normal temperature, the tympanic membranes appear normal, and her throat is clear. There is some tenderness of the right cheek and over the right orbit.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Maxillary and frontal sinusitis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomical explanation for this condition:</strong> Blocked drainage of the sinuses secondary to an allergic reaction of the nasal mucosa.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 10-year-old girl who had recently acquired a cat has had a headache for a 2-week duration. She is afebrile, with normal-appearing tympanic membranes and throat. She has right maxillary and frontal tenderness.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> Sinusitis, a condition common in Americans, is an inflammation of one or more of the six sets of paranasal sinuses, most of which are related to the orbits. Inflammation may be caused by viruses, allergies, and bacterial pathogens. The sinuses are usually sterile cavities that are lined by ciliated mucosa rich in mucous cells, and mucus drains directly into the nasal cavities through small openings, or ostia. Edema of the nasal mucosa can easily occlude these openings and lead to secondary infection. The maxillary sinus is most commonly involved, and sinus pain or pressure sensation is typical. Transillumination of the sinuses that demonstrates opacification may be helpful on physical examination. Radiographs may also be helpful; CT imaging is usually reserved for complicated cases. The recent acquisition of a cat by the patient suggests maxillary and frontal sinusitis caused by an allergy rather than an infectious agent. Oral or topical (spray) decongestants, antihistamines, and/or nasal steroids are often helpful. Antibiotics are not indicated at this time, but the patient should be instructed to watch for development of fever or an increase in tenderness. Complications include osteomyelitis, ocular cellulitis, and cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis.</p>

                    <li><strong>Tonsillectomy:</strong> Surgical removal of the palatine tonsils, often performed due to recurrent tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscesses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Waldeyer ring:</strong> A discontinuous ring of lymphoid tissue surrounding the pharynx, including the pharyngeal, palatine, and lingual tonsils.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The pharynx is a space within the head that connects the oral and nasal cavities to the trachea and esophagus. Air-filled spaces in the temporal bone (i.e., the tympanic cavity and the mastoid air cells) connect with the pharynx through the pharyngotympanic (Eustachian) tube. The walls of the pharynx are covered with mucosa. Deep to the mucosa are several aggregations of lymphoid tissue that form a ring around the pharynx, priming the immune system for defense against pathogens.</p>
                <p>The superior boundary of the pharynx is the base of the skull. The muscles of the pharyngeal walls form a cone that narrows to the esophagus. The medial pterygoid plates support the lateral walls of the superior part of the pharynx. The bodies of cervical vertebrae support the posterior wall. The anterior wall is interrupted by three apertures. One opens to the nasal cavity, another to the oral cavity, and a third to the larynx. Therefore, the pharynx is divided into three corresponding regions: the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx. The naso- and oropharynx are continuous, but are separated by elevation of the soft palate during swallowing to prevent reflux of food and liquid into the nasopharynx. The oro- and laryngopharynx are also continuous. Depression of the epiglottis during swallowing separates the larynx from the laryngopharynx, preventing aspiration into the trachea and lungs.</p>
                <p>The pharyngeal wall is composed of three muscles: the superior, middle, and inferior pharyngeal constrictors. The inferior part of the inferior constrictor muscle thickens as it merges with the esophagus, forming a sphincter called the cricopharyngeus muscle. The three constrictor muscles are stacked like ice-cream cones. Between the pairs of muscles are gaps that transmit important structures. The gap between the superior constrictor and the occipital bone transmits the pharyngotympanic tube, levator veli palatini muscle, and the ascending palatine artery. Between the superior and middle constrictors are the glossopharyngeal nerve and stylopharyngeus muscle. Between the middle and inferior constrictors course the internal laryngeal nerve and superior laryngeal artery. The recurrent laryngeal nerve and inferior laryngeal artery ascend deep to the inferior constrictor.</p>
                <p>The lymphoid tissue surrounding the pharynx is commonly called the Waldeyer ring, which is composed of three masses of lymphoid tissue: the pharyngeal tonsils (also called “adenoids” when enlarged), the palatine tonsils, and the lingual tonsils. The pharyngeal tonsils are located in the roof and posterior wall of the nasopharynx. The opening of the pharyngotympanic tube into the nasopharynx is protected by a tonsil. The palatine tonsils are located in the anterior wall of the oropharynx between the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal folds. The lingual tonsil is located under the mucosa of the posterior one-third of the tongue.</p>
                <p>The pharynx is supplied by arteries from several sources, most of which are branches of the external carotid artery, specifically the maxillary, facial, lingual, and superior thyroid arteries. The constrictor muscles are also supplied by branches from the deep cervical and the inferior thyroid arteries. With respect to this case, the most important vessels are the ascending palatine and tonsillar branches of the facial artery. Surgery to remove the palatine tonsil can damage the tonsillar branch, resulting in excessive bleeding. Venous drainage from the pharynx parallels the arterial supply. In addition, there is an extensive pharyngeal venous plexus on the posterior surface of the constrictor muscles. The external palatine vein descends along the lateral surface of the palatine tonsil to drain into the venous plexus. Therefore, this vessel may be damaged during surgery to remove a palatine tonsil, also resulting in excessive bleeding.</p>
                <p>The nerve supply to the pharynx is from cranial nerves IX and X. The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) supplies general sensory fibers to the mucosa of the pharynx. These fibers contribute to the afferent limb of the gag reflex. CN IX also supplies special sensory fibers mediating taste to the posterior one-third of the tongue. This nerve exits the cranium through the jugular foramen and descends with the stylopharyngeus muscle to pass through the gap between the superior and middle pharyngeal constrictor muscles. The vagus nerve (CN X) supplies general motor fibers to the constrictor muscles. These fibers contribute to the efferent limb of the gag reflex. This nerve also exits the cranium through the jugular foramen but descends within the carotid sheath. As it descends, it gives off branches that form the pharyngeal plexus on the posterior surface of the pharynx.</p>

                <h3>49.2 Clinical Case: Recurrent Tonsillitis</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 7-year-old boy was referred to an ear-nose-throat (ENT) specialist after having recurrent episodes of tonsillitis with peritonsillar abscesses. His mother noted about seven infections over the past 8 months, all treated with antibiotics. After discussing treatment options with the family, the ENT recommended a tonsillectomy. The patient’s tonsillectomy was complicated by bleeding from the surgical bed, and he had temporary loss of taste sensation from his posterior tongue. He is currently doing well and without complaints.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vessel involved with intraoperative bleeding:</strong> External palatine vein.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loss of taste sensation:</strong> Compression of glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 7-year-old boy status post-tonsillectomy for recurrent tonsillitis complicated by increased intraoperative bleeding and temporary loss of taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> For patients with recurrent episodes of tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscesses (>4 episodes per year), tonsillectomy may be indicated. Although tonsillectomy is thought of as a routine procedure, it is not without its complications/risks. A thorough understanding of the anatomy of the pharynx is necessary in order to limit complications. The tonsillar bed is extremely vascular with the most common source of intraoperative bleeding from the external palatine vein which arises from the lateral aspect of the tonsillar bed. Even if a direct injury does not take place, compression from edema may cause temporary injury as in this case. Compression of glossopharyngeal nerve branches causes a temporary loss in taste sensation on the posterior aspect of the tongue. As the swelling goes down, so does the nerve impairment. Many other vital vessels, nerves, and structures are adjacent to the tonsils and care must be taken to avoid injury.</p>

                <p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>List the landmarks of the anterior neck and identify the muscles of the infrahyoid region.</li>
                    <li>Describe the cartilaginous skeleton of the larynx and the positions of the vocal cords in relation to palpable landmarks.</li>
                    <li>Describe the thyroid gland’s relationship to the larynx and its blood supply.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ABCs:</strong> This mnemonic reminds us that the priorities of emergency management are airway, breathing, and circulation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Endotracheal intubation:</strong> Placement of a tube through the mouth or nose and through the vocal cords to secure the airway and/or provide mechanical ventilation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tracheostomy:</strong> Surgical establishment of an airway by an opening from the skin to the trachea. These are emergent, when endotracheal intubation is impossible, or elective, when the patient has need of a long-term airway.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cricothyroidotomy:</strong> Temporary method of establishing an airway by penetrating through the cricothyroid membrane. The procedure is nearly always performed emergently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cholecystectomy:</strong> Surgical procedure to remove the gallbladder.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sleep apnea:</strong> Condition in which the patient is unable to breathe due to temporary obstruction of the airway, usually occurring during sleep. Loud snoring, choking, or periods of cessation of breathing are typical.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Deep to the thin skin of the anterior neck is the platysma muscle, which is within the superficial fascia. Deep to the platysma are the infrahyoid (strap) muscles of the neck. The paired sternohyoid muscles extend from the posterior surface of the manubrium to the hyoid bone, and their medial borders are just lateral and parallel to the midline. The superior bellies of the omohyoid muscles lie just lateral to the sternohyoid muscles. Deep to these muscles are found the sternothyroid muscles and continuing superiorly are the thyrohyoid muscles.</p>
                <p>The skeleton of the larynx consists of the U-shaped hyoid bone, which lies at the level of the C3 vertebra, and nine cartilages. The epiglottis, thyroid, and cricoid cartilages are unpaired, whereas the arytenoids, corniculate, and cuneiform are paired. The thyroid cartilage, which resembles an open book, lies opposite the C4 and C5 vertebrae. Its two laminae are united anteriorly, and the laryngeal prominence (Adam’s apple) is easily palpated and typically visible in men. The cricoid cartilage is shaped like a signet ring, with its larger laminar portion being posterior. It lies opposite the C6 vertebra. The thyroid cartilage is joined to the hyoid bone above and the cricoid cartilage below by ligaments and membranes. The true vocal cords extend from the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages atop the lamina of the cricoid cartilage to the posterior surface of the thyroid cartilage superior to the lower border of the cartilage. The interval between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages is closed by the cricothyroid membrane and is inferior to the true vocal cords. The cricothyroid muscle is also found laterally in this interval.</p>
                <p>The thyroid gland, like the larynx, is enclosed within the pretracheal fascia. The large laterally placed lobes of the gland are applied to the surface of the laminae of the thyroid cartilage and the upper trachea, with the parathyroid glands embedded in their posterior surfaces. The right and left lobes are joined across the midline by the isthmus, which typically is inferior to the cricoid cartilage at the level of the second and third tracheal cartilage rings. In approximately 50 percent of individuals, a pyramidal lobe may be present that extends superiorly and overlies the cricothyroid membrane, but usually to one side of the midline. This remnant of the thyroglossal duct may be glandular or fibrous tissue. The thyroid and parathyroid glands are supplied by the paired superior thyroid arteries (direct branches from the external carotid arteries) and the inferior thyroid arteries, which are branches from the thyrocervical trunk. In 12 percent of individuals, a small midline artery, the thyroid ima artery, arises directly from the aortic arch or brachiocephalic trunk. It ascends on the anterior surface of the trachea to reach the isthmus.</p>

                <h3>50.2 Clinical Case: Emergency Tracheostomy</h3>
                <p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
                <p>A 47-year-old woman is undergoing surgical removal of her gallbladder (cholecystectomy). Her medical problems include insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and sleep apnea. After the anesthesiologist has administered the paralyzing agent (succinylcholine), the patient is found to have spasms of the airway and difficulty breathing with the bag and mask. The anesthesiologist attempts to place an endotracheal tube by direct visualization (direct laryngoscopy), without success due to swelling (laryngeal edema). Meanwhile, the oxygen saturation content of the blood has decreased to a very low range of 80 percent. The anesthesiologist remarks that an emergency airway needs to be surgically opened.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Next step:</strong> Emergency tracheostomy or cricothyroidotomy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Helpful anatomical landmarks:</strong> Cricoid and thyroid laryngeal cartilages.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A 47-year-old woman who had diabetes and sleep apnea is undergoing elective cholecystectomy. After receiving the paralyzing agent, the patient develops laryngospasm and is difficult to ventilate. Direct laryngoscopy and intubation attempts are unsuccessful, and oxygen saturation is low.</p>
                <p><strong>Clinical Correlation:</strong> One of the leading causes of mortality at elective surgery is related to anesthesia, specifically an inability to ventilate the patient. This woman is probably obese and difficult to intubate due to a short neck, and her sleep apnea is a concern. When oxygen saturation decreases to dangerous levels (<90 percent), brain and/or heart ischemia may ensue. Immediate correction of oxygenation is critical, and, as in this case, emergency tracheostomy is indicated. One of the fastest methods is to enter the cricothyroid membrane in the midline, between the cricoid and thyroid laryngeal cartilages. This interval is usually palpable and is approximately one-third the distance from the top of the manubrium to the tip of the chin (mentum). A vertical incision is made in the membrane and a tracheal tube is inserted. Alternatively, a needle can be inserted into the same membrane, and oxygen administered through a jet ventilator. However, this procedure must be revised rapidly because there is insufficient flow to remove carbon dioxide from the lungs. Nonemergency tracheostomies are performed inferiorly to the cricoid cartilage and the isthmus of the thyroid gland.</p>

                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> D. In up to 12 percent of individuals, a small midline artery, called the thyroid ima artery, arises from the aortic arch or brachiocephalic trunk and reaches the thyroid isthmus inferiorly.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>A 54-year-old woman has undergone partial thyroid resection due to a nontender cold nodule that likely represents cancer. One week after surgery, she complains of twitching of the right arm and “spasms” of both hands. Which of the following is the most likely explanation?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C. The parathyroid glands are variably inside the thyroid gland. With resections of the thyroid, the small parathyroid glands may be affected, leading to decreased levels of calcitonin and, hence, hypocalcemia. The low calcium levels may cause clinical symptoms of muscle spasms, tetany, or even convulsions.</p>
