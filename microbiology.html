            <p>A 53-year-old male farmer presents for evaluation of a growth on his arm. About a week ago, he noticed some mildly itchy red bumps on his arm. They started to blister a day or two later and then ruptured. During this time he had a low-grade fever, but otherwise felt well. Further questioning reveals that he has had no ill contacts and never had anything like this before. He has cows, horses, goats, sheep, and chickens on his farm. On examination of his right upper arm, you find a 4.5-cm circular black eschar surrounded by several vesicles (blisters) and edema. He has tender axillary lymph node enlargement (adenopathy). A Gram stain of fluid drained from a vesicle and a biopsy from the eschar both show chains of gram-positive bacilli on microscopy.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>What organism is the likely cause of this disease?</li>
                <li>What are the primary virulence factors of this organism?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organism:</strong> Bacillus anthracis</li>
                <li><strong>Virulence Factors:</strong> Capsular polypeptide and anthrax toxin</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
                <p>Bacillus anthracis is the etiologic agent of cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and inhalational anthrax. Approximately 95 percent of anthrax disease is cutaneous. Bacillus anthracis is distributed worldwide, and all animals are susceptible, but it is more prevalent in herbivores. Infected animals often develop a fatal infection and contaminate the soil and water with B. anthracis that can sporulate and continue to survive in the environment for many years. Oxygen is required for sporulation, and the spores will grow on culture plates, in soil, or in the tissue of dead animals. Human infections are caused by either penetration of these spores through the skin barrier (cutaneous), ingestion of the spores (rare), or inhalation of the spores (so-called wool-sorters’ disease), which usually occurs while processing animal products. Person-to-person transmission of anthrax has not been described. Cutaneous anthrax, the most common clinical manifestation, occurs within 2–3 days of exposure to an infected animal or animal product. A papule develops at the site of inoculation, which progresses to form a vesicle. A characteristic black eschar is formed after rupture of the vesicle and development of necrosis in the area. In rare cases the disease progresses and becomes systemic with local edema and bacteremia, which can be fatal.</p>
                <p>The only other Bacillus species frequently associated with human disease is B. cereus, which is a cause of gastroenteritis following ingestion of a contaminated food product, most commonly fried rice. The spores of B. cereus can also survive in the soil and be responsible for traumatic wound infections, particularly to the eye, when soil contamination is involved.</p>

                <h3>Approach to Suspected Anthrax Infection</h3>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Know the structure and characteristics of B. anthracis.</li>
                    <li>Know the clinical diseases caused by and virulence of B. anthracis.</li>
                    <li>Know the structure and characteristics of B. cereus.</li>
                    <li>Know the clinical diseases caused by and virulence of B. cereus.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eschar:</strong> Skin lesion associated with cutaneous anthrax and resembling a black, necrotic sore.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wool-sorters’ disease:</strong> Disease associated with inhalation of anthrax spores from infected animal products, most often associated with sheep wool.</li>
                    <li><strong>Differential diagnosis:</strong> Listing of the possible diseases or conditions that may be responsible for the patient’s clinical presentation.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Discussion</h4>
                <p>Bacillus species are large, motile, facultative anaerobic, gram-positive rods with a central spore. The spore is quite resistant to extreme conditions and can survive in nature for prolonged periods of time. Bacillus anthracis is nonmotile and on Gram stain is often seen in chains. The virulent forms of B. anthracis are more likely to be surrounded by a capsule. The organism can be cultured as large colonies on blood agar plates within 24 hours, often resembling a “Medusa head” (irregular appearance to the colony with swirling projections). The principal virulence factors of B. anthracis are the capsular polypeptide and anthrax toxin. The capsule consists of poly-D-glutamic acid, which is thought to allow the organism to resist phagocytosis.</p>
                <p>Anthrax toxin consists of three proteins: protective antigen, edema factor, and lethal factor. Protective antigen is named for its ability to confer immunity in experimental situations. Edema factor and lethal factor bind to protective antigen to form edema toxin and lethal toxin. The bound proteins are transported across cell membranes and are released in the cytoplasm where they exert their effects. Once the spores enter the body they are taken up by macrophages. Because of both lethal and edema factors, the spores survive killing, and subsequently germinate.</p>
                <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
                <p>The differential diagnosis of a patient (farmer) with fever, adenopathy, and black eschar include other cutaneous lesions such as furuncles (staphylococci), ecthyma gangrenosum (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and spider bites. However, none of these etiologies are known to cause eschar formation with surrounding edema. The specific diagnosis of anthrax is made by growth of the organism from blood (inhalation anthrax), or wound (cutaneous anthrax). Bacillus anthracis grows easily on most bacteriological culture media within 18–24 hours at 35°C (95°F). The organism is a nonmotile, spore-forming gram-positive bacillus that is nonhemolytic when grown on blood containing agar medium and produces lecithinase on egg yolk agar. Lecithinase is an enzyme produced by both B. anthracis and B. cereus that degrades the lecithin in the egg yolk agar leaving a white precipitate.</p>
                <p>Careful review of a Gram stain from a primary specimen of a patient with suspected anthrax is necessary, because the organisms have the propensity to easily decolorize and appear gram-negative. However, the presence of spores is a key to the identification of the organism as a gram-positive bacillus. Based on these few tests (large gram-positive bacilli, nonhemolytic, lecithinase positive) a presumptive identification of B. anthracis can be made. As a result of the recent events in the world leading to concerns over bioterrorism, definitive diagnosis of anthrax must be performed in a public health laboratory. Confirmatory testing involves the use of fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies as well as DNA amplification assays. The use of India ink can also help to determine the presence of a capsule, a relatively unique aspect. The capsule of B. anthracis is not stained by the India ink, which can be easily visualized against the dark background.</p>
                <h4>Treatment and Prevention</h4>
                <p>Ciprofloxacin is the drug of choice for anthrax, following the identification of weaponized strains that were resistant to penicillin as a result of the production of a β-lactamase. Prevention of anthrax involves vaccination of animals as well as humans at high risk of exposure (military personnel). Prophylaxis is not recommended for asymptomatic persons. When deemed necessary, prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin must be maintained for up to 30 days because of the potential delay in germination of inhaled spores.</p>

                        <li><strong>D.</strong> Spores can be observed as intracellular refractile bodies in unstained cell suspensions. Also, they are commonly observed by staining with malachite green or carbolfuchsin. The spore wall is relatively impermeable, but heating of the preparation allows dyes to penetrate. Alcohol treatment then serves to prevent spore decolorization. Finally, the spores are counterstained.</li>
                        <li><strong>B.</strong> Penicillin G was considered to be the first choice treatment for patients with cutaneous anthrax and when used should be continued for 7–10 days. However, because some naturally occurring isolates have been reported to be penicillin resistant (but still ciprofloxacin sensitive) and some patients are allergic to penicillin, ciprofloxacin is now considered to be the drug of choice for cutaneous anthrax.</li>
                        <li><strong>C.</strong> Virulent forms of B. anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, are more likely to be surrounded by a capsule. This capsule is a polypeptide, composed of a polymer of glutamic acid, and is a unique feature of B. anthracis.</li>

                </details>
                <h4>Microbiology Pearls</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The most common form of anthrax is cutaneous anthrax in which penetration of the skin by B. anthracis spores causes eschar formation with regional lymphadenopathy.</li>
                    <li>The organism is a nonmotile, spore-forming gram-positive bacilli that is nonhemolytic and produces lecithinase.</li>

                    <li>The drug of choice for treating anthrax is ciprofloxacin.</li>
                    <li>The two main methods of anthrax virulence are its capsule and toxin.</li>
                    <li>An eschar surrounded by edema is suspicious for anthrax.</li>

            <p>A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency room with severe abdominal pain. He has had mild, left lower abdominal cramping pain for about 3 days, which has worsened in the past 8 hours. He has also had nausea, fever, and chills. On examination, he is in obvious pain, has a fever of 38.6°C (101.5°F) and has an elevated heart rate (tachycardia). His abdominal examination is notable for absent bowel sounds, diffuse tenderness, and rigidity when palpated. An x-ray reveals the presence of free air in the abdominal cavity. He is taken for emergency surgery and found to have severe diverticulitis with a perforated colon. Cloudy peritoneal fluid is collected. An anaerobic culture grows Bacteroides fragilis.</p>

                <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
                <p>Bacteroides fragilis is one of the most clinically significant anaerobic organisms. It is part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and causes clinical infections when it escapes from this environment following surgery, traumatic bowel perforation, or other diseases, such as diverticulitis. Although many anaerobes are part of the normal gastrointestinal flora, B. fragilis is the most common cause of intraabdominal infections. Bacteroides fragilis is also associated with respiratory tract infections (sinusitis, otitis), genital tract infections, brain, skin, and soft tissue infections.</p>
                <p>Diverticulitis is an inflammation of a small food and particle collecting sac in the large intestine; it may lead to colonic rupture and therefore allow the organisms normally present in the GI tract to penetrate the peritoneal cavity and possibly the bloodstream. These infections usually involve a mixture of both aerobes and anaerobes.</p>

                <h3>Approach to Bacteroides fragilis</h3>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Know the microbiologic characteristics of B. fragilis and other Bacteroides species.</li>
                    <li>Know the virulence factors associated with B. fragilis.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Anaerobes:</strong> Organisms that do not require oxygen for growth and may die in its presence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bacteroides bile esculin (BBE) agar:</strong> Media selective for B. fragilis on which the colonies appear black.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diverticulitis:</strong> Inflammation of a diverticulum, which is a small bulging sac in the colon wall which can trap food particles and become inflamed and painful.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Discussion</h4>
                <p>Bacteroides species include the B. fragilis group as well as many other species. Two new genera were recently created, Prevotella and Porphyromas, to remove the pigmented, bile-sensitive anaerobes previously in the genus Bacteroides. All are small, anaerobic, gram-negative bacilli and many strains are encapsulated. Vacuolization, irregular staining, and pleomorphism are common. Bacteroides fragilis has a distinct capsule composed of two polysaccharides, which appears to inhibit phagocytosis and allow adherence to peritoneal surfaces. Other virulence factors for this bacterium include the presence of pili, which promote adherence to epithelial cells and the production of succinic acid, which inhibits phagocytosis. Bacteroides fragilis produces an endotoxin that has little biologic activity. It also produces superoxide dismutase, an enzyme, which allows the organism to survive in the presence of small amounts of oxygen.</p>
                <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
                <p>Anaerobes are not usually the primary cause of an infection, but are involved in a mixed aerobic, anaerobic infection. Often diagnosis of anaerobic infections is based on clinical features including a foul smelling wound with the presence of gas in the involved tissue usually located in close proximity to a mucosal surface. Infections that involve spillage of GI material into the peritoneum are likely to involve aerobes and anaerobes. The most commonly associated anaerobe is B. fragilis. Patients with severe diverticulitis, appendicitis, or colonic injury often develop B. fragilis peritonitis.</p>
                <p>To increase the chances of recovery of anaerobes from a specimen, the sample must be appropriately collected to allow survival of anaerobes. Anaerobes are organisms that do not require oxygen for growth. Sensitivity of the anaerobic organism can vary from those that cannot tolerate any oxygen (strict anaerobes) to those that can grow in the presence of small amounts of oxygen (oxygen tolerant). Anaerobes are therefore grown under atmospheric conditions that limit the presence of oxygen and include predominantly nitrogen, as well as hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Tissues or fluids collected and transported under anaerobic conditions are the most optimal; however, if necessary an anaerobic transport swab can also be used.</p>
                <p>Bacteroides species produce small colonies on anaerobic blood agar medium within 24 hours. Selective media such as kanamycin/gentamicin laked blood agar will support growth of gram-negative anaerobes only. Presumptive identification of B. fragilis can be made by growth of black pigmented colonies on Bacteroides bile esculin agar, and resistance to kanamycin, colistin, and vancomycin special potency antimicrobial disks. Definitive identification of anaerobes or B. fragilis is made with commercial identification systems that are based on the presence of preformed enzymes or in reference laboratories using gas liquid chromatography to determine the specific gases produced by the organism.</p>
                <h4>Treatment and Prevention</h4>
                <p>Surgical debridement is usually necessary at least in part for the treatment of anaerobic infections. β-Lactamase activity is common in Bacteroides species, especially B. fragilis, which results in resistance to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. Drugs of choice for Bacteroides species include β-lactam–β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole, and imipenem.</p>

                <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
                <p>Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease and is transmitted to humans by Ixodes ticks. This disease was first recognized in Old Lyme, Connecticut, with the identification of cluster cases of arthritis in children. The infection is characterized by a “bull’s eye” skin lesion, which develops from the site of the tick bite, 1–4 weeks postinfection. Additional initial symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, joint pain, or mild stiffness of the neck. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States, and if left undiagnosed and untreated, the infection usually progresses to involve the nervous or vascular systems and cause fluctuating or chronic arthritis.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Erythema migrans:</strong> Skin lesion composed of redness (erythema) with central clearing (target lesion).</li>
                    <li><strong>Spirochetes:</strong> Thin spiral bacteria of which three genera cause significant disease in humans: Leptospira, Borrelia, and Treponema, which lead to leptospirosis, Lyme disease, and syphilis, respectively.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Discussion</h4>
                <p>Borrelia burgdorferi belongs to the spirochete family of prokaryotes. It stains gram-negative, although spirochetes are considered neither gram-positive nor gram-negative. Spirochetes consist of a flexible, multilayer outer cell membrane and a more rigid, peptidoglycan-containing cytoplasmic membrane. Between these two layers are endoflagella that insert at the ends of the spirochete. Rotation of these flagella creates the characteristic cork-screw shape of these organisms. This provides for motility of the organism and hides the normally antigenic flagella from host defenses. These organisms are microaerophilic and have a doubling time of 8–24 hours. The disease is endemic in several regions of the United States including Northeastern, Midwest, and Pacific coast states. However, most reported cases occur in New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.</p>
                <p>The spirochetes that cause Lyme disease have been divided into genospecies. Three genospecies, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, and B. afzelii, are known to cause Lyme disease and are known collectively as B. burgdorferi sensu lato. The outer membrane of B. burgdorferi contains unique outer surface proteins (Osps), which are thought to play a role in their virulence. Small rodents, particularly the white-footed mouse, are the primary reservoirs of B. burgdorferi, and the vector of transmission is the Ixodes tick.</p>
                <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
                <p>The diagnosis of Lyme disease is made primarily by clinical presentation and patient history of exposure. Confirmation of a clinical diagnosis is made serologically via the detection of antibody by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbance or indirect immunofluorescence. However, serologic tests are most reliable 2–4 weeks postinfection, because of cross-reactivity with normal flora, and Western blot analysis should be used to confirm a positive serologic test. Alternately, new PCR-based tests are available to detect B. burgdorferi DNA.</p>
                <h4>Treatment and Prevention</h4>
                <p>Initial stages of infection with B. burgdorferi can be effectively treated with doxycycline or amoxicillin, while later stages of disease are better treated with penicillin G or ceftriaxone. Prevention of infection involves limiting exposure to ticks by wearing protective clothing in endemic areas, including long sleeves and long pants tucked into socks. Careful search for and removal of ticks is also an important preventative measure.</p>

                <p>More than 50 serotypes of C. jejuni have been identified based on heat labile (capsular and flagellar) antigens. Campylobacter jejuni is endemic worldwide, and most cases of infection are associated with eating poorly cooked chicken, although milk, water, and other meats have also been implicated. Human-to-human transmission is rare. Campylobacter jejuni is one of the most frequent causes of bacterial diarrhea occurring most often in the summer or early fall. The incubation period is 1–3 days followed initially by symptoms of fever, malaise, and abdominal pain. Campylobacter jejuni can cause bloody diarrhea, mucosal inflammation, and bacteremia, suggesting that it is invasive to the lining of the intestine. Most cases of Campylobacter gastroenteritis is self-limited, with symptoms resolving within 7 days; however, relapses can occur in 5–10 percent of cases which are untreated.</p>

                <h3>Approach to Suspected Campylobacter Infection</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Guillain-Barré syndrome:</strong> A demyelinating disease resulting from similarities between the host and the surface of the Campylobacter organism.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fecal leukocytes:</strong> White blood cells present in the stool, which correlate loosely with the presence of an invasive pathogen.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Discussion</h4>
                <p>Campylobacter species are small motile, nonspore-forming, comma-shaped, gram-negative bacilli. Its motility is the result of a single flagellum located at one or both poles of the organism. Campylobacter does not grow in aerobic or anaerobic environments. It is microaerophilic, requiring 5–10 percent oxygen and high concentrations of carbon dioxide for growth. Campylobacter jejuni grows better at 42°C (107.6°F) than 37°C (98.6°F).</p>
                <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
                <p>The differential diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis would include Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, as well as Campylobacter. Because of the feature of abdominal pain and cramps, sometimes in the absence of diarrhea, Campylobacter gastroenteritis can be misdiagnosed as appendicitis or irritable bowel syndrome. The presence of bloody diarrhea may also suggest enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli.</p>
                <p>Definitive diagnosis would be made by culture of the stool and growth of Campylobacter. Campylobacter are more fastidious than most other causes of bacterial gastroenteritis and specimens should be transported to the laboratory in media such as Cary-Blair. Selective media such as campy blood agar or Skirrow medium, which includes antibiotics to inhibit the normal stool flora, allows for growth of Campylobacter within 48–72 hours.</p>
                <h4>Treatment and Prevention</h4>
                <p>Most often C. jejuni infection is self-limited and does not require specific antimicrobial therapy. Supportive care, that is, hydration, is often the only treatment needed. If specific therapy is needed for severe disease, or infection in immunocompromised patients, erythromycin is the drug of choice, because of the recent increase in resistance to fluoroquinolones.</p>

            <p>A 19-year-old woman presents for the evaluation of pelvic pain. The pain has progressively worsened over the past week. She has also been having some burning with urination and a vaginal discharge. She is sexually active, has had four lifetime partners, takes oral contraceptive pills, and occasionally uses condoms. On examination, she appears in no acute distress and does not have a fever. Her abdomen is soft with moderate lower abdominal tenderness. On pelvic examination, she is noted to have a yellow cervical discharge and significant cervical motion tenderness. No uterine or adnexal masses are palpated, but mild tenderness is also noted. A Gram stain of the cervical discharge reveals only multiple polymorphonuclear leukocytes. A direct DNA probe test subsequently comes back positive for Chlamydia trachomatis.</p>

                <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
                <p>Chlamydia trachomatis is the causative agent of the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, and it is also the greatest cause of preventable blindness around the world. Chlamydial disease affects women five times more often than men, and approximately two-thirds of those affected lack symptoms and thus, do not know that they are infected. Many of those infected with gonorrheal disease are also infected with Chlamydia, as both organisms infect the columnar epithelial cells of the mucous membranes.</p>

                    <li>Know the characteristics of the Chlamydia species.</li>
                    <li>Know the virulence factors and diseases associated with Chlamydia bacteria.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Elementary body:</strong> Nondividing 300-nm infectious particle. This particle has an outer membrane with disulfide linkages which allows it to survive extracellularly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chandelier sign:</strong> Cervical motion tenderness during the bimanual exam, characteristic of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).</li>
                    <li><strong>Exudate:</strong> Material, such as fluids, cells or debris, which has extravasated from vessels and has been deposited on tissue surfaces or in tissue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Papule:</strong> Small palpable elevated lesion that is less than 1 cm.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Discussion</h4>
                <p>Chlamydia trachomatis is a gram-negative obligate intracellular parasite with a unique life cycle. It is coccoid in morphology and is very small, usually about 350 nm in diameter. Although C. trachomatis is classified as gram-negative bacteria, it lacks a peptidoglycan layer and muramic acid, which are present in other gram-negative organisms. There are many disulfide linkages present in the outer membrane which stabilize the organism. Its extracellular form is called the elementary body, which has a small, spore-like structure.</p>
                <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
                <p>Infection with C. trachomatis can be rapidly diagnosed by detection of the bacterial nucleic acid in patient samples from the oropharynx, conjunctiva, urethra, or cervix. Other specimens such as the conjunctiva can be cultured using McCoy cells in a tissue culture assay. Diagnostic tests for nucleic acid detection include PCR amplification or direct DNA hybridization assays.</p>
                <h4>Treatment and Prevention</h4>
                <p>Currently, the best method of preventing chlamydial infection is education and proper sanitation. Ocular infection of C. trachomatis can sometimes but not always be prevented by administration of topical tetracycline drops. It is the lack of this antibiotic in underdeveloped countries that makes C. trachomatis prevalent in these areas. Chlamydia trachomatis, C. psittaci, and C. pneumonia are all treated with tetracycline or erythromycin.</p>

The virulence factors of C. difficile include toxin production as well as production of other enzymes, such as hyaluronidase. Toxin A is an enterotoxin, and Toxin B, the more biologically active toxin in humans, is a cytotoxin.</p>
                <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
                <p>Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is the most common cause of diarrhea that develops in patients who have been hospitalized for 3 or more days. Clinical diagnosis can be made by visualization of the pseudomembrane (fibrin, bacteria, cell debris, white blood cells). The gold standard for laboratory diagnosis of antibiotic-associated diarrhea caused by C. difficile is detection of toxin production in the stool using a tissue culture assay.</p>
                <h4>Treatment and Prevention</h4>
                <p>The first-line treatment for C. difficile disease is oral metronidazole, with oral vancomycin reserved for those who fail first-line treatment. Unfortunately, relapse can occur in 20–30 percent of adequately treated patients because of the resistance of the spores to treatment.</p>

            <p>A 6-year-old girl is brought into the office for evaluation of a sore throat and fever, which she has had for approximately 4 days. Her parents have immigrated to the United States from Russia about 6 months ago. She has not had much medical care in her life, and her immunization status is unknown. On examination the child is anxious, tachypneic, and ill appearing. Her temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), and her voice is hoarse. Examination of her pharynx reveals tonsillar and pharyngeal edema with the presence of a gray membrane coating of the tonsil, which extends over the uvula and soft palate. She has prominent cervical adenopathy. Her lungs are clear. You immediately transfer her to the local children’s hospital with the presumptive diagnosis of pharyngeal diphtheria and order confirmatory tests.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>What Gram stain characteristics does Corynebacterium diphtheriae have on microscopy?</li>
                <li>What factor is required for the expression of diphtheria toxin?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Characteristics of C. diphtheriae on Gram stain:</strong> The club-shaped appearance of the gram-positive bacillus, often characterized as “Chinese letters” because of adherence of cells following division.</li>
                <li><strong>Factor required for the expression of diphtheria toxin:</strong> Lysogenic bacteriophage.</li>

                <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
                <p>Corynebacteria are ubiquitous in nature and are part of the normal flora of the human respiratory tract and skin. Although most species of Corynebacterium can be opportunistic pathogens, only a few species are commonly associated with human disease. Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the cause of diphtheria, is one of the most pathogenic of the species. Humans are the only known reservoir and transmission is thought to occur by contact with aerosolized droplets, respiratory secretions, or infected skin lesions.</p>

                </ul>
                <h4>Discussion</h4>
                <p>Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a nonencapsulated gram-positive bacillus. It is nonmotile, non-spore-forming, and club shaped. The cells often remain attached after division and form sharp angles, giving a characteristic “Chinese letter” appearance on microscopy.</p>
                <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
                <p>The differential diagnosis in the presence of sore throat, fever, and cervical lymphadenopathy would include streptococcal pharyngitis and infectious mononucleosis. Clinical diagnosis of diphtheria can be made by visualization of the characteristic pseudomembrane formation.</p>
                <h4>Treatment and Prevention</h4>
                <p>Therapy for diphtheria is a combination of antimicrobial therapy (erythromycin) and antitoxin. The antitoxin must be administered rapidly, before the toxin binds to epithelial cells. Diphtheria can be prevented by vaccination with diphtheria toxoid (DPT).</p>

        <h2>Chapter 8: Enterococcus faecalis</h2>
        <h3>Case Description</h3>
        <p>A 72-year-old female nursing home resident with advanced Alzheimer’s disease, bed-bound, and with an indwelling Foley catheter, presents with fever and altered mental status. Her baseline mental status is awake but oriented only to person. She has a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), tachycardia, and is mumbling incoherently. Her urine is cloudy, and urinalysis shows numerous white blood cells and bacteria. Gram stain reveals gram-positive cocci, and cultures confirm the same.</p>

        <h3>Answers to Case 8</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most likely etiology of infection:</strong> Enterococcus faecalis</li>
            <li><strong>Mechanism of antibiotic resistance:</strong> DNA mutation, or plasmid or transposon transfer</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>Enterococci, normal gastrointestinal flora, are common in nosocomial urinary tract infections (UTIs), especially in catheterized patients. They can cause bacteremia and, rarely, endocarditis, particularly in elderly patients with underlying heart conditions. Transmission is often linked to abdominal or genital procedures.</p>

            <li><strong>Transposons:</strong> DNA segments that can insert randomly into chromosomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Leukocyte esterase:</strong> Enzyme indicating leukocyte presence in urine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>Enterococcus faecalis is an aerobic, gram-positive coccus, resilient to extreme conditions like high pH and bile salts. It resembles streptococci morphologically, possessing group D antigen. Its virulence includes adherence factors and intrinsic resistance to antibiotics like ampicillin and aminoglycosides, with acquired resistance via mutations or plasmid/transposon transfer, including vancomycin resistance to Staphylococcus aureus.</p>
        <p>Diagnosis involves urinalysis showing white blood cells and bacteria, confirmed by culture (>10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL for clean catch urine). E. faecalis appears nonhemolytic on blood agar and is identified by PYR test or bile-esculin hydrolysis. Treatment uses ampicillin or vancomycin with aminoglycosides for complicated cases; resistant strains may require linezolid. Prevention involves infection control to limit nosocomial spread.</p>

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>E. coli, the most common aerobic gram-negative bacillus in the GI tract, causes over 80% of UTIs. It also causes gastroenteritis, sepsis, and neonatal meningitis. Diarrhea is often acquired in developing countries, with serotypes like O157:H7 causing bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). UTIs result from vaginal or GI bacteria ascending to the bladder, often facilitated by adhesions.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>E. coli, part of Enterobacteriaceae, ferments glucose, is oxidase-negative, and reduces nitrates to nitrites. Its adhesins enable attachment to urinary/GI epithelia, and exotoxins (e.g., shiga, heat-stable, heat-labile, hemolysins) cause inflammation or diarrhea. Diagnosis involves urinalysis and culture (>10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL), with E. coli appearing as pink, lactose-fermenting colonies on MacConkey agar. Treatment uses trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or fluoroquinolones, as E. coli is often resistant to ampicillin. Prevention includes hydration and complete bladder emptying.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 15: Mycoplasma pneumoniae</h2>
        <h3>Case Description</h3>
        <p>A 15-year-old teenager presents with a persistent cough and fever after exposure to a friend with “walking pneumonia.” His symptoms include low-grade fever, headache, myalgias, and fatigue, progressing to a persistent cough. His temperature is 38.1°C (100.5°F), pulse is 90 beats per minute, and respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute. Examination shows an injected pharynx and scattered rhonchi in the lungs. A chest x-ray reveals patchy infiltration, and sputum Gram stain shows white blood cells but no organisms.</p>

        <h3>Answers to Case 15</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most likely infectious agent:</strong> Mycoplasma pneumoniae</li>
            <li><strong>Reason no organisms are seen on Gram stain:</strong> Mycoplasma pneumoniae lacks a cell wall, making it unstainable.</li>
            <li><strong>Rapid blood test for presumptive evidence:</strong> Cold agglutinins</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>Mycoplasma pneumoniae, transmitted via aerosolized respiratory droplets, is a common cause of atypical pneumonia in children and adolescents. It typically presents with an insidious onset, progressing to tracheobronchitis or patchy pneumonia. The absence of a cell wall prevents visualization on Gram stain and confers resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. Serologic testing, including cold agglutinins, is often used for diagnosis due to slow culture times.</p>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Understand the structure and physiology of M. pneumoniae and other Mycoplasma species.</li>
            <li>Know the clinical diseases and diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Definitions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tracheobronchitis:</strong> Inflammation of the trachea and bronchi, causing airway narrowing.</li>
            <li><strong>Rhonchi:</strong> Coarse, rattling lung sounds due to partially obstructed airways.</li>
            <li><strong>Pruritus:</strong> Itching, potentially caused by various factors including infections.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a small, strictly aerobic rod without a cell wall, making it resistant to β-lactam antibiotics. It remains extracellular during infection and divides slowly (6-hour doubling time), complicating culture-based diagnosis. Its adherence protein P1 enables attachment to respiratory epithelium, destroying cilia and cells, impairing mucociliary clearance. Transmission occurs via respiratory droplets, with a 1–3 week incubation period. Diagnosis relies on serologic tests (e.g., enzyme immunoassays, complement fixation) or cold agglutinin titers (≥1:128 or fourfold increase). Treatment involves macrolides (e.g., erythromycin) or tetracyclines. Prevention is challenging due to prolonged infectivity, and vaccine attempts have been unsuccessful.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 16: Neisseria</h2>
        <h3>Case Description</h3>
        <p>A 19-year-old woman presents with a swollen left knee, achiness in multiple joints, and a low-grade fever, localizing to septic arthritis. She has a history of Chlamydia infection and is sexually active with multiple partners. Examination shows erythema, warmth, and a joint effusion in the left knee, with limited movement due to pain. Joint aspiration is performed.</p>

        <h3>Answers to Case 16</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Likely Gram stain findings of joint fluid:</strong> Multiple polymorphonuclear leukocytes with intracellular gram-negative diplococci.</li>

        <h2>Chapter 19: Salmonella and Shigella</h2>
        <h3>Case Description</h3>
        <p>A 48-year-old man presents with 2 days of crampy abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever after eating “sunny-side up” eggs. He has a positive tilt test, indicating volume depletion, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. His stool is heme-negative and watery.</p>

        <h3>Answers to Case 19</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most likely etiology:</strong> Salmonella</li>
            <li><strong>Common sources of infection:</strong> Undercooked poultry, eggs, dairy, or contaminated surfaces</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>Salmonella, transmitted via contaminated food (e.g., poultry, eggs), causes self-limited gastroenteritis with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It invades M cells in Peyer’s patches, potentially causing bacteremia in vulnerable populations. Shigella, causing bloody diarrhea due to mucosal invasion, mimics Salmonella but is less likely to cause bacteremia. Both are Enterobacteriaceae, with Salmonella being motile and Shigella nonmotile.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>Salmonella, a motile, gram-negative bacillus, resists phagocytosis via acid tolerance and invasion proteins. Shigella, nonmotile, produces shiga toxin, destroying intestinal mucosa. Diagnosis involves stool culture on selective media (e.g., Hektoen enteric agar), with Salmonella showing H2S production (black colonies). Nontyphoidal Salmonella gastroenteritis is self-limited, requiring supportive care, while typhoid fever or bacteremia needs antibiotics (e.g., quinolones). Shigella treatment uses quinolones to reduce spread. Prevention includes proper food handling and typhoid vaccination for travelers.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 21: Staphylococcus</h2>
        <h3>Case Description</h3>
        <p>A 15-year-old male develops nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea shortly after returning from an outdoor party where hamburgers, hot dogs, potato salad, baked beans, and lemonade were served. The food was left on an outdoor picnic table, and symptoms began about 4 hours after eating. He is unable to keep anything down, has no fever, and reports no blood in stool or vomit. Three other guests reported similar symptoms.</p>

        <h3>Answers to Case 21</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most likely organism causing this infection:</strong> Staphylococcus aureus</li>
            <li><strong>Response to request for antibiotic:</strong> No, the gastroenteritis is caused by a preformed toxin, not by ingested staphylococci, so antibiotics are ineffective.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> commonly colonizes the human nasopharynx and skin, causing infections when the skin barrier is disrupted. It leads to localized skin infections, bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and toxin-mediated diseases like toxic shock syndrome, scalded skin syndrome, and gastroenteritis. Community-acquired MRSA, often producing Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL), causes severe skin infections and necrotizing pneumonia. Staphylococcal food poisoning, the second most reported foodborne illness in the U.S., results from enterotoxin in contaminated foods like processed meats or potato salad, causing rapid-onset nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea within 2–6 hours, resolving within 12–24 hours.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, a nonmotile, nonspore-forming, facultative anaerobic gram-positive coccus, grows in clusters due to bound coagulase ("clumping factor"). It produces cytolytic toxins, exfoliative toxins, enterotoxins, and toxic shock syndrome toxin, acting as superantigens. Enterotoxins are heat-stable, surviving 100°C for 30 minutes. Most <em>S. aureus</em> strains produce penicillinase, and many have altered penicillin-binding protein (PBP2), conferring resistance to methicillin and cephalosporins. Resistance genes spread via plasmids, transduction, or cell-to-cell contact. Diagnosis involves Gram stain showing gram-positive cocci in clusters and culture on blood agar (β-hemolytic). <em>S. aureus</em> is coagulase-positive, unlike other staphylococci. Treatment for severe infections uses vancomycin initially, with nafcillin for susceptible strains. Prevention includes handwashing and decolonization with mupirocin.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 22: Treponema pallidum</h2>
        <h3>Case Description</h3>
        <p>A 20-year-old man with a 4–5 day history of flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, headache, body aches) develops a diffuse erythematous, maculopapular rash covering his body, including palms and soles. He denies dysuria or penile discharge but recalls a painless penile sore a few months ago that resolved spontaneously. Examination shows cervical, axillary, and inguinal adenopathy.</p>

        <h3>Answers to Case 22</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most likely causative organism:</strong> Treponema pallidum</li>
            <li><strong>Disease and stage:</strong> Secondary syphilis</li>
            <li><strong>Microscopic examination to confirm diagnosis:</strong> Darkfield microscopy of lesion exudates</li>
            <li><strong>Serologic tests for diagnosis:</strong> VDRL and RPR for screening; FTA-ABS and MHA-TP for confirmation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p><em>Treponema pallidum</em>, a gram-negative, microaerophilic spirochete, causes syphilis, a common bacterial STD. Transmitted via contact with infectious lesions or transplacentally, it progresses through primary (painless chancre), secondary (rash, flu-like symptoms), latent, and tertiary stages (gummas, neurosyphilis). Secondary syphilis is highly infectious, with rashes on palms and soles being a key diagnostic clue.</p>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Understand the natural history of syphilis infection.</li>
            <li>Know diagnostic and treatment methods for syphilis.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Macule:</strong> Flat, non-palpable lesion, different in color from surrounding skin, <1 cm.</li>
            <li><strong>Microaerophilic:</strong> Organisms tolerating low oxygen levels using superoxide dismutase.</li>
            <li><strong>Tabes dorsalis:</strong> Neurosyphilis with loss of reflexes, pain, and proprioception.</li>
            <li><strong>Argyll Robertson pupil:</strong> Pupil constricting during accommodation but not reacting to light.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p><em>Treponema pallidum</em>, a thin, labile spirochete, cannot be cultured and is visualized via darkfield microscopy. It causes disease through immune responses, with no known toxins. Primary syphilis presents with a painless chancre; secondary syphilis shows a maculopapular rash and condyloma latum. Diagnosis uses darkfield microscopy or serologic tests (VDRL/RPR for screening, FTA-ABS/TP-PA for confirmation). Treatment involves benzathine penicillin; erythromycin or doxycycline for penicillin-allergic patients (doxycycline avoided in pregnancy). Prevention includes safe sex practices.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 23: Vibrio cholerae</h2>
        <h3>Case Description</h3>
        <p>A 35-year-old woman presents with severe diarrhea and vomiting after a mission trip to rural Africa, where she ate undercooked shrimp. She has watery diarrhea, no fever, and signs of hypovolemic shock (pulse 115 bpm, BP 80/50 mm Hg, dry mucous membranes). Labs show elevated WBC, hematocrit, hypokalemia, low bicarbonate, and prerenal azotemia.</p>

        <h3>Answers to Case 23</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most likely etiologic agent:</strong> Vibrio cholerae</li>
            <li><strong>Cause of diarrhea:</strong> Hypersecretion of water and electrolytes due to cholera toxin</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p><em>Vibrio cholerae</em> causes cholera, characterized by severe watery diarrhea leading to dehydration and hypovolemic shock. Transmitted via contaminated water or food (e.g., shellfish), it is prevalent in areas with poor sanitation. The cholera toxin causes massive fluid loss by activating adenyl cyclase. Other Vibrio species, like <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> (gastroenteritis) and <em>V. vulnificus</em> (wound infections), are less severe but can be fatal in immunocompromised patients.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p><em>Vibrio cholerae</em>, a motile, curved, gram-negative bacillus with a polar flagellum, is facultative anaerobic and thrives in saltwater. Serotypes O1 and O139 cause cholera pandemics. The cholera toxin, with five B subunits and one A subunit, activates adenyl cyclase, causing fluid hypersecretion. Diagnosis involves stool culture on TCBS agar (yellow colonies). Treatment prioritizes fluid replacement (IV saline or oral rehydration) and doxycycline to reduce duration. Prevention includes water treatment and thorough cooking of seafood.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 26: Salmonella</h2>
        <h3>Case Description</h3>
        <p>A 30-year-old man presents with fever, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea for 3 days after eating at a local restaurant. He reports nausea and fatigue but no vomiting. Examination shows a temperature of 38.5°C, mild abdominal tenderness, and no rash. Stool culture is pending.</p>

        <h3>Answers to Case 26</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most likely organism:</strong> Salmonella enteritidis</li>
            <li><strong>Transmission route:</strong> Ingestion of contaminated food (e.g., poultry, eggs)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p><em>Salmonella</em> species, gram-negative bacilli, cause gastroenteritis, enteric fever, and bacteremia. Non-typhoidal <em>Salmonella</em> (e.g., <em>S. enteritidis</em>) is a common cause of foodborne illness, transmitted via undercooked poultry, eggs, or contaminated produce. Symptoms include fever, diarrhea (often bloody), and abdominal pain, resolving within 4–7 days in healthy individuals. Typhoidal <em>Salmonella</em> (e.g., <em>S. typhi</em>) causes typhoid fever, a systemic illness with prolonged fever and potential complications like intestinal perforation.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enteric fever:</strong> Systemic infection caused by <em>Salmonella typhi</em> or <em>paratyphi</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Carrier state:</strong> Asymptomatic shedding of <em>Salmonella</em> in stool, often after typhoid fever.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p><em>Salmonella</em>, a motile, gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacillus, survives in macrophages, evading host defenses. Its lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and type III secretion system contribute to virulence. Diagnosis involves stool or blood culture, with <em>Salmonella</em> growing as non-lactose-fermenting colonies on MacConkey agar. Treatment for uncomplicated gastroenteritis is supportive; severe cases or typhoid fever require fluoroquinolones or ceftriaxone. Prevention includes proper food handling and cooking.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 27: Epstein-Barr Virus</h2>
        <h3>Case Description</h3>
        <p>A 17-year-old female presents with a sore throat and fever for one week, worsening over time. She is extremely fatigued, spending most of the last 3 days in bed. She denies ill contacts, has no significant medical history, takes no medications, and has no allergies. Examination shows she is tired and ill-appearing, with a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F). Her tonsils are markedly enlarged, erythematous, and covered with white exudates. She has tender cervical adenopathy. A cardiovascular exam is normal, and her abdomen is soft, nontender, without organomegaly. A rapid streptococcal antigen test is negative, but amoxicillin is started for presumed strep pharyngitis. Two days later, her mother reports a red rash from head to toe, attributed to an allergic reaction to amoxicillin.</p>

        <h3>Answers to Case 26</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Infectious mononucleosis</li>
            <li><strong>Most likely etiology:</strong> Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)</li>
            <li><strong>Cells for replication and latent infection:</strong> EBV replicates in epithelial cells and B cells, causing latent infections in B cells.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human herpesvirus, causes infectious mononucleosis, often called the “kissing disease” due to transmission via saliva. Common in adolescents and young adults, it leads to fever, fatigue, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and sometimes hepatosplenomegaly. Symptoms can mimic streptococcal pharyngitis, and amoxicillin treatment often triggers a maculopapular rash. EBV is also linked to Burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and lymphoproliferative diseases in immunocompromised patients.</p>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Understand the genomic and structural characteristics of EBV.</li>
            <li>Describe the clinical disease, transmission, and treatment strategies for EBV.</li>

            <li><strong>Heterophile antibodies:</strong> Nonspecific IgM antibodies recognizing Paul-Bunnell antigen on sheep, horse, and bovine erythrocytes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>EBV, a double-stranded DNA herpesvirus, is enveloped with glycoprotein spikes for attachment to B cells and epithelial cells via the C3d complement receptor. It has two subtypes (EBV-1, EBV-2) differing in nuclear antigens. EBV replicates in epithelial cells (lytic infection) and establishes latency in B cells, promoting growth and preventing apoptosis. Diagnosis involves detecting atypical lymphocytes, heterophile antibodies (via Monospot test), or EBV-specific antibodies (VCA, EBNA) via ELISA. No specific treatment or vaccine exists; management is supportive. Complications include laryngeal obstruction, meningitis, encephalitis, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and splenic rupture.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 28: Hepatitis C Virus</h2>
        <h3>Case Description</h3>
        <p>A 62-year-old man presents for follow-up after abnormal blood test results from a routine physical. Two weeks ago, liver enzymes were elevated three times the upper limit of normal. He denies alcohol or drug use, medications, or jaundice history. His past medical history includes hospitalization at age 45 for a bleeding stomach ulcer requiring surgery and a 4-unit blood transfusion. He has had no recurrences. Physical examination is normal, with no jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, or portal hypertension signs.</p>

        <h3>Answers to Case 27</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most likely infectious etiology:</strong> Hepatitis C virus (HCV)</li>
            <li><strong>Most likely transmission route:</strong> Blood transfusion</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is primarily transmitted parenterally via blood transfusions or intravenous drug use, rarely sexually. Most infections are asymptomatic initially, but 50–85% progress to chronic infection, potentially leading to cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Routine blood screening for HCV began in 1992, reducing transfusion-related cases.</p>

        <h3>Definitions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hepatitis:</strong> Liver inflammation caused by viruses (A, B, C, D, E, G), presenting with fever, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, pale feces, and elevated liver enzymes.</li>
            <li><strong>Fulminant hepatitis:</strong> Severe acute hepatitis causing rapid liver destruction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>HCV, a lipoprotein-enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family, has multiple genotypes due to a hypervariable envelope region. It enters cells via CD81 receptor-mediated endocytosis, replicating in the cytoplasm and inhibiting apoptosis and interferon-α. Diagnosis uses enzyme immunoassay for anti-HCV IgG or RT-PCR for viral RNA. Treatment includes interferon-α and, in end-stage cases, liver transplantation, though reinfection is common. No vaccine exists; prevention involves blood screening and avoiding contaminated needles.</p>

        <p>HSV, enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses of the Herpesviridae family, enter via mucosal membranes or skin breaks, replicating in epithelial cells and establishing latency in neurons (e.g., trigeminal ganglia for HSV-1). Diagnosis involves visualizing multinucleated giant cells (Tzanck smear), viral culture, or PCR. Treatment uses acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir to shorten symptoms. Prevention includes avoiding contact with lesions and cesarean delivery for neonates of mothers with active genital HSV.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 30: Human Immunodeficiency Virus</h2>
        <h3>Case Description</h3>
        <p>A 28-year-old man presents with a rash on his chest, consisting of oval-shaped, purplish, firm macules (0.5–4 cm), some confluent. He reports a 15-lb weight loss, 6 weeks of diarrhea, and a 3-week sore throat. Examination shows white plaques on the posterior pharynx and soft palate. A punch biopsy confirms Kaposi sarcoma.</p>

        <h3>Answers to Case 29</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Likely virus:</strong> Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)</li>
            <li><strong>Cells infected and binding site:</strong> CD4 surface receptor on macrophages and T lymphocytes</li>
            <li><strong>Serologic testing:</strong> HIV ELISA and Western blot, or PCR</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>HIV, a retrovirus, causes AIDS by depleting CD4 T cells, leading to immunosuppression and opportunistic infections like Kaposi sarcoma. It is transmitted via blood, sexual contact, or perinatal routes. Diagnosis involves ELISA for antibodies, confirmed by Western blot or PCR for viral RNA. Treatment with HAART slows disease progression but is not curative.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Retrovirus:</strong> RNA virus transcribing RNA into DNA via reverse transcriptase.</li>
            <li><strong>HAART:</strong> Highly active antiretroviral therapy combining drugs to inhibit HIV replication.</li>
            <li><strong>AIDS:</strong> Immunodeficiency from HIV with low CD4 counts and opportunistic infections.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>HIV, an enveloped retrovirus with two positive-sense RNA copies, uses reverse transcriptase to integrate into the host genome. It binds CD4 receptors on T cells and macrophages via gp120, with gp41 facilitating entry. Diagnosis uses ELISA, Western blot, or PCR for viral RNA. HAART includes reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. Prevention involves safe sex and blood screening; no effective vaccine exists due to viral variability.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 31: Human Papillomavirus</h2>
        <h3>Case Description</h3>
        <p>A 42-year-old woman presents for a routine gynecologic exam, having not had a Pap smear in 5 years. She is asymptomatic, with a history of three vaginal deliveries, Chlamydia at age 22, and a 25-year smoking history. She is sexually active with a live-in boyfriend and has had 7 lifetime partners. Her exam is normal, but the Pap smear shows high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.</p>

        <h3>Answers to Case 30</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most likely infectious etiology:</strong> Human papillomavirus (HPV)</li>
            <li><strong>High-risk virus types:</strong> HPV types 16 and 18</li>
            <li><strong>Replication sites:</strong> In benign diseases, HPV replicates extrachromosomally in epithelial cell nuclei; in malignancies, viral DNA integrates into the host genome.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>HPV infects squamous epithelium, causing warts and papillomas. Types 16 and 18 are linked to cervical and anogenital carcinomas. Risk factors include multiple sexual partners, smoking, and immunosuppression. Most infections are benign, but high-risk types can lead to malignancy via integration into the host genome.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 32: Varicella-Zoster Virus</h2>
        <h3>Case Description</h3>
        <p>A 6-year-old boy presents with a rash for 2 days, starting as red spots on his trunk and spreading to his face and limbs. He has a low-grade fever (38°C, 100.4°F) and mild itching. His mother reports he was exposed to a classmate with chickenpox 2 weeks ago. He is unvaccinated. Examination shows vesicles and pustules in various stages on his trunk, face, and extremities, with some crusting.</p>

        <h3>Answers to Case 31</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most likely viral cause:</strong> Varicella-zoster virus (VZV)</li>
            <li><strong>Transmission route:</strong> Respiratory droplets or direct contact with lesions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Clinical Correlation</h3>
        <p>Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox (varicella) in primary infection, characterized by a vesicular rash, fever, and itching, primarily in children. It spreads via respiratory droplets or contact with lesions. After resolution, VZV remains latent in sensory ganglia, potentially reactivating as shingles (herpes zoster) in adults, causing a painful, unilateral rash along dermatomes.</p>

            <li><strong>Postherpetic neuralgia:</strong> Persistent pain following herpes zoster.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>VZV, an enveloped, double-stranded DNA herpesvirus, replicates in epithelial cells and establishes latency in sensory neurons. Chickenpox is diagnosed clinically by its characteristic rash; shingles by its dermatomal distribution. PCR or viral culture confirms diagnosis. Treatment for severe cases or immunocompromised patients uses acyclovir or valacyclovir. The varicella vaccine prevents primary infection, and the zoster vaccine reduces shingles risk in adults.</p>
