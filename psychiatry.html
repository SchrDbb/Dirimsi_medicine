        <h2>Case 1: Major Depression, Recurrent</h2>
        <p>A 42-year-old man comes to his outpatient psychiatrist with complaints of a depressed mood, which he states is identical to depressions he has experienced previously. He was diagnosed with major depression for the first time 20 years ago. At that time, he was treated with imipramine, up to 150 mg/d, with good results. During a second episode, which occurred 15 years ago, he was treated with imipramine, and once again his symptoms remitted after 4 to 6 weeks. He denies illicit drug use or any recent traumatic events. The man states that although he is sure he is experiencing another major depression, he would like to avoid imipramine this time because it produced unacceptable side effects such as dry mouth, dry eyes, and constipation.</p>

        <h3 id="case1-answers">Answers to Case 1</h3>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>A 42-year-old man complains of symptoms of major depression identical to two prior episodes he experienced in the past. Previously, he was successfully treated with a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), although this class of medication often produces anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth, dry eyes, and constipation, of which this patient complains. The question becomes what medication should be used to treat recurrent major depression when tricyclics are not an option.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Best therapy:</strong> A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, fluoxetine, or fluvoxamine is one of the first-line choices of medication for this patient. Selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRI) such as venlafaxine and duloxetine are also first-line treatment options.</li>
            <li><strong>Common side effects:</strong> Gastrointestinal symptoms—stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhea—occur in early stages of the treatment. Minor sleep disturbances—either sedation or insomnia—can occur. Other common side effects include tremor, dizziness, increased perspiration, and male and female sexual dysfunction (most commonly delayed ejaculation in men and decreased libido in women).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="case1-analysis">Analysis</h3>
        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Understand the treatment of uncomplicated major depression without psychotic features.</li>
            <li>Be able to counsel a patient in regard to the common side effects of SSRIs and SSNRIs.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Considerations</h4>
        <p>Although the patient has been successfully treated with a TCA (imipramine) two times in the past, these medications are no longer considered first-line treatments because of their common side effects and their potential lethality in overdose (cardiac arrhythmias). For a patient such as this one, one might consider using imipramine again. However, the patient specifically requests another type of medication because of his previous discomfort with the side effects. Current first-line treatments for patients with major depression, SSRIs or SSNRIs, are thus the logical choice; they have fewer side effects and are safer.</p>

        <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
        <p>Major depression is a common problem. In the United States, approximately one in seven individuals will suffer from this disorder at some time in their lives. Women are affected twice as often as men, with a mean age of occurrence at 40 years. A common hypothesis concerning the etiology of major depressive disorder involves the alteration of biogenic amines, particularly norepinephrine and serotonin. Genetics plays a role, as evidenced by family studies.</p>
        <p>Given the frequency with which depression is a presenting complaint in the primary care setting, a mnemonic is helpful in remembering the criteria for an episode of major depression. As lack of energy is common to most of these episodes, the mnemonic relates to “treating” this symptom by “prescribing energy capsules” and is written on a prescription as SIG: E(nergy) CAPS. Each letter stands for a criterion (except for depressed mood) used in diagnosing an episode of major depression:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>S—sleep changes</li>
            <li>I—(decreased) interest</li>
            <li>G—(excessive) guilt</li>
            <li>E—(decreased) energy</li>
            <li>C—(decreased) concentration</li>
            <li>A—appetite changes</li>
            <li>P—psychomotor agitation or retardation</li>
            <li>S—suicidal ideation</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Differential Diagnosis</h4>
        <p>It is important to rule out other disorders that could be causing a depressed state, including medical diseases (e.g., hypothyroidism or multiple sclerosis), medications (e.g., antihypertensives), or substances (e.g., alcohol use or cocaine withdrawal). Obtaining a thorough history, performing a physical examination, and ordering appropriate laboratory studies are crucial in the assessment of any new onset of depression.</p>
        <p>Many psychiatric illnesses are characterized by depressive symptoms, including psychotic disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders. A critical distinction to make, especially in recurrent episodes of depression, is between major depressive disorder, recurrent, and bipolar disorder, depressed. This distinction is essential not only for making the correct diagnosis but also for proper treatment. Standard therapies for major depression can be less effective and actually worsen bipolar illnesses. It is necessary to obtain any current or past history of episodes of mania, as well as any family history of bipolar disorder.</p>

        <h4>Assessment of Suicide Risk</h4>
        <p>One of the most important determinations a clinician must make in the case of a depressed individual is the risk of suicide. The best approach is to ask the patient directly using questions such as, “Are you or have you ever been suicidal?” “Do you want to die?” A patient with a specific suicide plan is of special concern. The psychiatrist should also be alert to warning signs such as an individual becoming uncustomarily quiet and less agitated after a previous expression of suicidal intent or making a will and giving away personal property. Risk factors for suicide include older age, alcohol or drug dependence, prior suicide attempts, male gender, and a family history of suicide.</p>
        <p>Adults with major depressive disorder being treated with antidepressants should be observed for worsening depressed mood and suicidality, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes (either increases or decreases).</p>
        <p>The results of a careful mental status examination, risk factors, prior suicidal attempts, and suicidal thoughts and intent must be all considered when assessing suicidal risk.</p>

        <h4>Postpartum Depression</h4>
        <p>As many as 20% to 40% of US women report some emotional disturbance or problem with cognitive functioning during the postpartum period. Many experience what is known as postpartum blues, in which there is sadness, strong feelings of dependency, frequent crying spells, and dysphoria. These feelings, which do not constitute major depression and therefore should not be treated as such, seem to be attributable to a combination of the rapid hormonal shifts occurring during the postpartum period, the stress of childbearing, and the sudden responsibility of caring for another human being. Postpartum blues usually last for several days to a week. In rare cases, postpartum depression exceeds in both severity and length that observed in postpartum blues and is characterized by suicidality and severely depressed feelings. Women with postpartum depression need to be treated as one would treat a patient with major depression, taking care to educate them as to the risks of breast-feeding an infant since the antidepressant appears in the milk. Left untreated, postpartum depression can worsen to the point that the patient becomes psychotic, in which case antipsychotic medication and hospitalization can become necessary.</p>

        <h4>Treatment</h4>
        <p>In individuals who suffer from one episode of major depression, there is a 50% to 85% chance of having another episode. The risk of recurrence increases not only with each subsequent episode but also with the occurrence of residual symptoms of depression between episodes, comorbid psychiatric disorders, and chronic medical conditions. Therefore, adequate treatment resulting in full remission is the goal. The treatment options for recurrent episodes of major depression are not significantly different from those for a first episode: pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy (for mild or moderate symptomatology), a combination of the two, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in major depression with psychotic features or where a rapid response is required.</p>
        <p>Common first-line pharmacotherapy for episodes of major depression includes SSRIs (such as fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, and citalopram), SSNRIs (such as venlafaxine and duloxetine), bupropion, and mirtazapine. Side effects vary among the specific medications and include sedation or activation, weight gain, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, tremor, elevated blood pressure (for venlafaxine at higher doses), and sexual dysfunction, particularly with SSRIs and venlafaxine. Although efficacy is essentially equivalent among all classes of antidepressants, TCAs such as desipramine and nortriptyline are usually not considered first-line agents because their side effects are less well tolerated. These side effects include anticholinergic effects, orthostasis, and cardiac effects leading to lethality in overdose. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are used less frequently because of their significant drug–drug interactions and because dietary restrictions are necessary.</p>
        <p>A rule of thumb in managing recurrent episodes of major depression is that the particular medication that achieved remission in past episodes is likely to achieve remission in subsequent episodes, often at the same dose. Additional factors to consider when choosing a medication are prior side effects, drug–drug interactions, cost, and patient preference.</p>

        <h4>Answers</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>1.1 A.</strong> Although a change in appetite, decreased energy, fatigue, and suicidal ideation are all criteria used in diagnosing major depressive disorder, one of the symptoms must be either a depressed mood or anhedonia.</li>
            <li><strong>1.2 E.</strong> The proper strategy in the management of an episode of major depression that has recently remitted is to continue treatment at the same dose if it can be tolerated. Early discontinuation of medication can lead to an early relapse. A general rule of thumb is, “The dose that got you better will keep you well.” A reasonable duration for continuing the medication is 6 to 9 months.</li>
            <li><strong>1.3 A.</strong> Although activation (causing insomnia), gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea), and tremor are common side effects of SSRIs, only sexual dysfunction generally occurs later in the treatment course (after weeks to months).</li>
            <li><strong>1.4 D.</strong> The recommendations for maintenance therapy in major depressive disorder should be made on a case-by-case basis. However, the illness tends to run a chronic course, especially if treatment is discontinued. Indeed, 50% to 85% of individuals will suffer from at least one further episode, most likely within 2 to 3 years.</li>

        <h2>Case 2: Schizophrenia, Paranoid</h2>
        <p>A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by the police after he was found sitting in the middle of traffic on a busy street. By way of explanation, the patient states, “The voices told me to do it.” The patient says that for the past year he has felt that “people are not who they say they are.” He began to isolate himself in his room and dropped out of school. He claims that he hears voices telling him to do “bad things.” There are often two or three voices talking, and they often comment to each other on his behavior. He denies that he currently uses drugs or alcohol, although he reports that he occasionally smoked marijuana in the past. He says that he has discontinued this practice over the past 6 months because he can no longer afford it, and claims that marijuana helped with the voices. He denies any medical problems and is taking no medication.</p>
        <p>On a mental status examination, the patient is noted to be dirty and disheveled, with poor hygiene. He appears somewhat nervous in his surroundings and paces around the examination room, always with his back to a wall. He states that his mood is “okay.” His affect is congruent, although flat. His speech is of normal rate, rhythm, and tone. His thought processes are tangential, and loose associations are occasionally noted. His thought content is positive for delusions and auditory hallucinations. He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation.</p>

        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after exhibiting bizarre and dangerous behavior. For at least 1 year, he experienced delusions and auditory hallucinations. The hallucinations consist of several voices commenting on the patient’s behavior and giving him commands. He became socially isolated and dysfunctional as a result of these symptoms. He denies current drug use or medical problems. A mental status examination shows several abnormalities. Disturbances in grooming, hygiene, and behavior (paranoia) are noted, and he has a flat affect. His thought processes are occasionally loose, and he reports auditory hallucinations and delusions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Schizophrenia, probably paranoid type.</li>
            <li><strong>Important conditions to rule out:</strong> To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia, psychosis secondary to substance abuse and general medical conditions must be ruled out. In addition, schizoaffective disorder and mood disorders must also be excluded.</li>
            <li><strong>Should this patient be hospitalized?</strong> Yes. He clearly poses a danger to himself (and potentially to others based on the undetermined nature of “bad things” he is being commanded to perform) because he listens to the voices and acts on their instructions so as to put himself at risk for serious physical harm (i.e., sitting in the middle of a busy street).</li>

        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Understand diagnostic criteria of schizophrenia.</li>
            <li>Understand that other conditions must be ruled out before such a diagnosis can be made.</li>

        <h4>Considerations</h4>
        <p>This patient demonstrates the two main diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia: delusions (thinks people are not who they say they are) and auditory hallucinations. The hallucinations are characteristic of those seen in schizophrenia, as there are several voices speaking to each other, and there is both a commentary and command nature to the hallucinations. On a mental status examination, the patient shows loosening of associations as well. He meets the criterion for social and/or occupational dysfunction, as he has dropped out of school and socially isolated himself. He has had the disorder for at least 1 year. He denies mood symptoms, drug abuse, and medical problems, although of course these issues would need to be further investigated by obtaining a more complete history, performing a physical examination, and ordering the appropriate laboratory tests.</p>

        <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
        <p>Schizophrenia is defined as a disturbance that lasts at least 6 months and includes at least 1 month of active-phase symptoms (two or more of the following: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, loose associations). There is a 1% lifetime prevalence in the general population, but only about half of those affected ever obtain treatment. The average age of onset is 18 to 25 years in men and 25 to 35 years in women. Women tend to have better outcome than men. Between 20% and 40% of schizophrenics attempt suicide. Specific risk factors include depressive symptoms—especially hopelessness, under 45 years of age, male gender, unemployment, and recent discharge from the hospital. Ten percent of schizophrenics will successfully complete suicide. The course of schizophrenia is variable. Some individuals demonstrate exacerbations and remissions, whereas others remain chronically ill. Complete remission is unlikely. Significant lifelong impairment is experienced by 40% to 60% of patients.</p>
        <p>There are five subtypes of schizophrenia:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Paranoid:</strong> Characterized by preoccupation with one or more delusions or frequent auditory hallucinations.</li>
            <li><strong>Disorganized:</strong> Usually characterized by disorganized speech and behavior, with flat or inappropriate affect.</li>
            <li><strong>Catatonic:</strong> Characterized by two or more of the following: (a) motor immobility (catalepsy/stupor), (b) excessive purposeless motor activity, (c) extreme negativism (maintenance of rigid posture) or mutism, (d) peculiar voluntary movements such as posturing, stereotyped movements, prominent mannerisms or grimacing, and (e) echolalia/echopraxia.</li>
            <li><strong>Undifferentiated:</strong> Two or more of the following are present: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized behavior, and negative symptoms, but the patient does not meet the criteria for the other subtypes of this disorder.</li>
            <li><strong>Residual:</strong> Characterized by the absence of prominent delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or grossly disorganized/catatonic behavior. Continuing evidence of disturbance is indicated by the presence of negative symptoms or two or more criteria in an attenuated form.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Differential Diagnosis</h4>
        <p>Most important and immediate in the differential diagnosis are medical conditions characterized by psychotic symptoms such as deliria, dementias, severe hypothyroidism, and hypercalcemia. Clues are usually provided by the patient’s history or the presentation (e.g., no prior psychiatric history, a late age of onset, a positive review of systems). The physical examination and/or results from laboratory studies (e.g., thyroid function tests, determination of electrolyte levels, rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) assist in clarifying the diagnosis.</p>
        <p>Alcohol and illicit drugs, either during intoxication (hallucinogens, cocaine, phencyclidine, methamphetamine) or withdrawal (alcohol, benzodiazepines), can produce psychotic symptoms. In particular, phencyclidine intoxication can appear identical to those of schizophrenia. A thorough substance use history, a physical examination including the measurement of vital signs, a determination of blood alcohol level, and a urine toxicology screening reveal substance use as a causal factor in most cases.</p>
        <p>A careful examination of the medications a patient is taking, including over-the-counter and herbal supplements, is also important, as many medications (e.g., steroids and anticholinergics) can cause psychotic states. Distinguishing schizophrenia from both schizoaffective disorder and mood disorders with psychotic features (such as major depression or bipolar disorder) can be difficult. Patients are frequently poor historians given their psychotic symptoms, and so gathering information from other sources such as prior records, family members, or significant others is imperative because a complete history is needed to clarify the issue.</p>

        </table>

        <h4>Treatment</h4>
        <p>The cornerstone in the treatment of schizophrenia is the use of newer, atypical antipsychotic medications, including risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole. Although clozapine is beneficial, especially in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, the possibility of agranulocytosis prevents it from being a first-line drug. Atypical antipsychotics have several advantages over older “typical” antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol. Although typical medications adequately treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, they can worsen or actually cause negative symptoms. Atypical medications appear to treat the positive symptoms (at least as well as the older medications) and also treat the negative symptoms. Metabolic syndrome, consisting of obesity, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, has been identified as a significant issue in treatment with atypical antipsychotics. Clozapine and olanzapine tend to be the worst, whereas ziprasidone and aripiprazole have the least associated problems with metabolic syndrome.</p>
        <p>Older antipsychotics also have a higher likelihood of causing unwanted side effects, namely, extrapyramidal symptoms (dystonias, Parkinsonian symptoms, and akathisia), hyperprolactinemia (leading to impotence, amenorrhea, or gynecomastia), and tardive dyskinesia. Acute symptoms such as dystonic reactions and Parkinsonian symptoms can be managed by reducing the dose or adding an anticholinergic drug such as benztropine. In addition, akathisia can respond to benzodiazepines or a beta-blocker such as propranolol. Unfortunately, tardive dyskinesia is usually a permanent condition and can be both disfiguring and disabling. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is the most severe potential side effect and can occur with any antipsychotic at any time during treatment. Treatment of NMS is largely supportive; dantrolene and bromocriptine are commonly used therapeutic agents.</p>

        <h4>Answers</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>2.1 B.</strong> Although all these symptoms can be seen in various psychotic disorders, the presence of a bizarre delusion is the most specific to schizophrenia. Only one psychotic symptom is needed to diagnose schizophrenia if there are bizarre delusions, auditory hallucinations commenting on the patient, or two or more voices speaking to each other.</li>
            <li><strong>2.2 C.</strong> The most likely diagnosis for this man is schizophrenia. He has been suffering from psychotic symptoms including delusions and auditory hallucinations for more than 6 months. Although he can have brief periods of depressed mood, he does not have a history of major mood disorder.</li>
            <li><strong>2.3 A.</strong> The most likely diagnosis for this man is major depression with psychotic features. Significant depression and neurovegetative symptoms are present, as well as delusions and auditory and visual hallucinations. Although he has mood symptoms and psychotic symptoms, his history is consistent with major depression because his mood symptoms preceded his psychotic symptoms.</li>
            <li><strong>2.4 B.</strong> The most likely diagnosis for this woman is schizoaffective disorder. She describes a 6-month history of ideas of reference, delusions, and auditory hallucinations. In addition, she has had clear manic symptoms for the past month, including an elevated mood, a decreased need for sleep, increased energy, increased goal-directed activities, and talkativeness. Although she has symptoms consistent with schizophrenia, she has had a significant episode of mood disorder during her psychotic illness. Her psychotic symptoms, which preceded and occurred in the absence of mood symptoms, make primary mood disorder (mania) with psychotic features less likely.</li>

        <p>A 36-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with a chief complaint of “I think that I am going crazy.” She states that for the past 3 months, she has been experiencing sudden episodes of palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, and feeling as if she is going to die. She states that the first time this happened she was walking down the street, not thinking about “anything in particular.” The episode lasted approximately 15 minutes, although the patient says that it felt like it lasted much longer. Since that time she has had similar episodes once or twice a day that have occurred unexpectedly in different situations. As a result she finds herself worrying almost constantly about when she is going to have another attack. She denies having any other symptoms. She has been to the emergency department twice in the past 2 weeks, convinced that she is having a heart attack. However, the results of all her physical and laboratory examinations have been within normal limits. She denies drug use and uses alcohol only “occasionally.” Her alcohol intake has decreased since the episodes began. Her only medical problem is a 1-year history of hypothyroidism for which she takes Synthroid (levothyroxine).</p>

        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>A 36-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with a chief complaint and symptoms consonant with panic disorder (feeling as if she is going crazy or going to die, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, sweating, trembling, and dizziness). She has been to the emergency department several times with the same symptoms, and no physical problems were found. The episodes have occurred once or twice a day for several months, and nothing in particular seems to precipitate them. The patient spends a lot of time between attacks worrying about when she is going to have another attack. The episodes last approximately 15 minutes. The patient denies alcohol or drug abuse, and her only medical problem is hypothyroidism.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Top two diagnoses in the differential:</strong> Panic disorder versus medication (Synthroid)-induced anxiety disorder.</li>
            <li><strong>Next diagnostic step:</strong> Obtain a thyroid profile and look for elevated levels of thyroid hormone, which if present could explain her symptoms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="case3-analysis">Analysis</h3>
        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Correctly diagnose panic disorder in a patient.</li>
            <li>Be aware that medical illnesses (or some substances) can cause panic attacks.</li>
            <li>Understand how to rule out a medical illness or substance use issue by requesting the appropriate laboratory studies.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Considerations</h4>
        <p>This woman presents with classic symptoms of a panic attack. The attacks first appeared “out of the blue” and have occurred once or twice a day, every day, for the past several months. They are short-lived in duration, lasting about 15 minutes per episode. The patient spends a lot of time in between the attacks worrying about having another attack, a classic feature of the disease. The patient does not seem to have any symptoms of any other psychiatric disorder. She denies drug or alcohol use other than the occasional use of alcohol (which should be carefully quantified). She has hypothyroidism that is being treated with Synthroid (levothyroxine), which has been known to cause panic attacks when the dose is too high; thyroid studies should be used to rule out this possibility. If the thyroxine level is too high, the diagnosis would be substance-induced anxiety disorder and not anxiety disorder secondary to hyperthyroidism, as might be considered. If the patient has panic disorder, she should be treated with a combination of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy; a short-acting benzodiazepine (alprazolam) can be added for immediate control of her symptoms. The use of benzodiazepine should be discontinued after the first several weeks. If the patient has an anxiety disorder because of a substance (thyroid medication), the dose should be decreased, and the panic symptoms should remit.</p>

        <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
        <p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) requires that at least one panic attack be followed by concern about another attack, fear of the implications of the attack, or a change in behavior related to the attack. The DSM-IV has established two diagnostic criteria for this disorder: panic disorder with agoraphobia (anxiety about being in places or situations from which escape would be difficult) and without agoraphobia. It is theorized that agoraphobia stems from the fear of having a panic attack in a place from which escape would prove difficult.</p>
        <p>Typically, the first panic attack an individual experiences is spontaneous; however, it can also follow excitement, exertion, or an emotional event. The attack begins within a 10-minute period of rapidly intensifying symptoms (extreme fear or a sense of impending doom) and can last up to 20 to 30 minutes. Patients with agoraphobia avoid being in situations where obtaining help from friends or loved ones would be difficult. These individuals typically need to be accompanied when traveling or when in enclosed areas (tunnels, elevators). Severely affected individuals do not even leave their own homes.</p>
        <p>In the general population, the lifetime prevalence rate of panic disorder ranges from 1.5% to 5%. The mean age of presentation is 25 years of age, with women being two or three times more likely to be affected than men. Approximately one-third of patients with panic disorder also have agoraphobia.</p>

        <h4>Differential Diagnosis</h4>
        <p>At the top of the differential diagnosis list for panic disorder are the numerous medical conditions that can cause panic attacks. Table 3–3 lists some of them. Intoxication caused by amphetamines, cocaine, or hallucinogens and by withdrawal from alcohol or other sedative-hypnotic agents can mimic panic disorder. Medications such as steroids, anticholinergics, and theophylline are also well known to produce anxiety. Underlying endocrine disorders should also be considered. In cases of difficult-to-manage hypertension accompanied by physical symptoms such as racing heart, sweating, nervousness, headache, muscle tension, chest pain, and abdominal distress, pheochromocytoma should be suspected. Tachycardia, heat intolerance, weight loss, and anxiety are features of hyperthyroidism which may be mistaken for an anxiety disorder. Obtaining a thorough history (including details of alcohol and substance use), performing a physical examination, and ordering appropriate lab studies (i.e., TSH, plasma metanephrine) can usually clarify the issue. Except for the elevated blood pressure and pulse rate found in anxious states, no abnormalities are seen on examination. Any significant abnormal findings discovered should prompt a further workup for a nonpsychiatric cause. Treating the underlying conditions, adjusting medications, and/or initiating a detoxification process are also likely to resolve the anxiety symptoms.</p>
        <p>Distinguishing panic disorder from other anxiety disorders can often be confusing. Panic attacks can be seen in many other anxiety states, as well as in depression. In fact, major depressive disorder has a high rate of comorbidity with panic disorder. The hallmark of panic disorder is unexpected panic attacks not provoked by any particular stimulus. This condition is distinct from other anxiety disorders, where panic attacks are the result of exposure to a certain cue. For example, a car backfiring might provoke a panic attack in a patient with posttraumatic stress disorder, or being near a dog might provoke a panic attack in someone with a specific phobia to dogs. The other important aspect to remember is that in panic disorder, the fear is actually of having an attack, not of a specific situation (contamination in the case of obsessive-compulsive disorder or performance in the case of social phobia) or of a number of activities (as in generalized anxiety disorder).</p>

        <h4>Treatment</h4>
        <p>Antidepressants such as SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors are highly effective in treating panic disorder. Best results are obtained when medication is used in combination with a course of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). As in depression, a significant therapeutic effect may not be seen for several weeks. Treatment with a benzodiazepine may be needed on a short-term basis to provide more immediate relief. Given the addictive potential of benzodiazepines, as well as the significant comorbidity of alcohol abuse in panic disorder, the goal should be to use as small a dose for as short a period of time as possible, with the intention of discontinuing this medication once the antidepressant reaches full effect.</p>
        <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy teaches the patient about the disorder, helps reduce or eliminate core fears, and specifically addresses the restrictions on lifestyle present in individuals with this condition.</p>

        <h4>Answers</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>3.1 D.</strong> The most likely diagnosis for this man is social phobia. Although he suffers from panic attacks, they are not unprovoked as in panic disorder because they occur in response to public speaking. His fear is not of having further attacks but rather of being embarrassed or humiliated. For generalized anxiety disorder the anxiety and worry is not confined to being embarrassed as in social phobia, rather it involves excessive anxiety and worry about a number of events or activities. Specific phobia is characterized by an excessive fear that is cued by the presence or anticipation of a specific object or situation (e.g., flying, animals) rather than social or performance situations.</li>
            <li><strong>3.2 B.</strong> This woman most likely has panic disorder with agoraphobia. She experiences recurrent spontaneous panic attacks and between attacks worries about having further attacks. She avoids driving away from her home for fear of being unable to obtain help in the event of an attack.</li>
            <li><strong>3.3 E.</strong> Specific phobia is the most likely diagnosis for this woman. Although she has panic attacks, they are not unexpected and result from being in a high place. Her fears are actually of a situation (heights) rather than of having further panic attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>3.4 C.</strong> The most likely diagnosis for this man is panic disorder without agoraphobia. He displays characteristic features of panic attacks, such as recurrent episodes of anxiety associated with physical symptoms. These episodes are spontaneous, and he worries about the consequences of having an additional attack, namely, a myocardial infarction.</li>

        <h2>Case 4: Hypothyroidism with Depression</h2>
        <p>A 55-year-old woman comes to a psychiatrist complaining of experiencing a depressed mood over the past 3 months. She notes that her mood has been consistently low, and she describes her condition as “just not me.” She has also noticed a decrease in energy and a weight gain of 6 to 7 lb. occurring over the same period of time, although her appetite has not increased. She has never visited a psychiatrist before and does not remember ever feeling this depressed for this long before. She states that she has no medical problems that she is aware of and takes no medications. Her family history is positive for schizophrenia in one maternal aunt.</p>
        <p>On a mental status examination the patient appears depressed and tired, although she has a normal range of affect. Her thought processes are linear and logical. She is not suicidal or homicidal and does not report hallucinations or delusions.</p>
        <p>Her physical examination reveals a blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg and a temperature of 98°F (36.7°C). Her thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged but not painful. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm. She has coarse, brittle hair but no rashes.</p>

        <h3 id="case4-answers">Answers to Case 4</h3>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>A 55-year-old woman presents to a psychiatrist with a depressed mood, decreased energy, and weight gain. She has never had these symptoms before. The results of the rest of her mental status examination are normal. Her physical examination is notable for a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Mood disorder secondary to a general medical condition.</li>
            <li><strong>Next diagnostic step:</strong> Obtain thyroid studies for this patient, including determinations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine, and thyroxine levels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="case4-analysis">Analysis</h3>
        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Recognize mood disorder occurring secondary to a general medical condition.</li>
            <li>Use the most likely diagnosis for this patient to guide the laboratory examination(s) required for a patient with suspected hypothyroidism.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Considerations</h4>
        <p>Although this patient’s history is consistent with that of a major depressive episode, two elements are atypical. While weight gain is observed in patients with major depression with atypical features, this condition is usually accompanied by an increase in appetite. A weight gain in the absence of an increase in appetite is a clue to the metabolic changes caused by this patient’s hypothyroidism. At times the clinical features of hypothyroidism may be evident. An enlarged thyroid is not seen in patients with major depression, but it is a clue that guides the specific laboratory examinations chosen in this case.</p>

        <h3 id="case4-approach">Approach to Mood Disorder because of a General Medical Condition</h3>
        <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
        <p>Diagnosis of this disorder requires a disturbance in mood that causes significant distress or an impairment in functioning. It can resemble either an episode of depression (depressed mood or decreased pleasure) or an episode of mania (elevated or irritable mood). The history, the physical examination, or the laboratory findings must demonstrate a causal physiologic relationship between the medical illness and the change in mood. In other words, the depression or mania cannot result only from the stress of having a medical condition. The mood episode also should not occur only during a delirium.</p>

        <h4>Differential Diagnosis</h4>
        <p>The differential diagnosis for mood disorder due to a general medical condition is large given the numerous medical and neurologic conditions that can cause depression or mania. Table 4–1 lists many of them. Also important in this differential diagnosis are substance-induced mood disorders caused not only by alcohol and illicit drugs (in intoxication and in withdrawal) but also by a vast number of medications. See Table 4–2 for a partial list of medications that can cause depressive symptoms. Making a distinction between primary (psychiatric) and secondary (induced) mood disorder can sometimes be difficult, especially because stressors such as medical illnesses themselves can trigger episodes of both major depression and mania.</p>
