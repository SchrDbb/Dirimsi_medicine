            <h2>Case 7: HIV and Pneumocystis Pneumonia</h2>
            <div class="case-content">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>A 32-year-old man with known HIV infection presents with subacute fever, dry cough, and worsening dyspnea. He is not on antiretroviral therapy or prophylactic medications. Chest x-ray shows diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and he is tachypneic and hypoxemic. Oral thrush suggests immunosuppression. Leukocyte count is low (<3500 cells/mm³), and LDH is elevated.</p>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the most likely diagnosis?</li>
                    <li>What is the next step?</li>
                    <li>What other diagnoses should be considered?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Answers</h3>
                <p><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> AIDS and probable Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).<br>
                <strong>Next step:</strong> Obtain arterial blood gas measurement to quantify hypoxemia, as it impacts treatment.<br>
                <strong>Other diagnoses:</strong> Tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, cryptococcosis, disseminated histoplasmosis, and community-acquired pneumonias (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma, influenza).</p>
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand the natural history of HIV infection.</li>
                    <li>Know opportunistic infections at various HIV immunocompromise levels.</li>
                    <li>Be familiar with respiratory infections in AIDS.</li>
                    <li>Understand indications for antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic medications.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Considerations</h4>
                <p>Subacute dyspnea, dry cough, and elevated LDH suggest PCP. Oral thrush indicates a CD4 count <250 cells/mm³, and if <200, PCP is likely. Arterial blood gas guides prognosis and therapy (e.g., corticosteroids for PO2 <70 mm Hg or A-a gradient >35 mm Hg, followed by TMP-SMX).</p>
                <h3>Approach to HIV Infections</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pneumocystis jirovecii:</strong> Unicellular fungus causing pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, especially HIV with CD4 <200 cells/mm³.</li>
                    <li><strong>AIDS:</strong> CD4 count <200 cells/mm³ or an AIDS-defining illness in an HIV-positive patient.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>Assess CD4 count to gauge immunodeficiency. Normal CD4 is 600-1500 cells/mm³. Below 500, patients are prone to recurrent pneumonias, TB, candidiasis, and herpes zoster. Below 200, PCP, toxoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis occur. Below 50, CMV and MAC are risks. PCP diagnosis often requires sputum induction or bronchoalveolar lavage. Treatment includes TMP-SMX, with corticosteroids for severe hypoxia. Other infections (TB, cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis, CMV, MAC) are considered based on clinical and radiographic findings. Prophylaxis (e.g., TMP-SMX for PCP at CD4 <200) and HAART are critical.</p>
                <h3>Comprehension Questions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>A 32-year-old woman with HIV (CD4 100 cells/mm³) has fever, shortness of breath, and dry cough. Which test confirms the diagnosis?</li>
                    <li>Which organism is most likely to cause lobar pneumonia in an AIDS patient?</li>
                    <li>A 44-year-old woman with HIV (CD4 180 cells/mm³) needs prophylaxis. Which is recommended?</li>
                    <li>A 36-year-old woman with HIV has new-onset seizures and multiple ring-enhancing brain lesions. What is the best therapy?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Answers to Comprehension Questions</h3>
                <p>1. A (Silver stain of sputum for PCP).<br>
                2. D (Streptococcus pneumoniae).<br>
                3. C (Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP).<br>
                4. D (Sulfadiazine with pyrimethamine for toxoplasmosis).</p>
                <h3>Clinical Pearls</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>PCP typically presents subacutely with fever and dry cough in patients with CD4 <200 cells/mm³, often with elevated LDH.</li>
                    <li>Pulmonary TB in AIDS may have atypical radiographic findings.</li>
                    <li>Community-acquired pneumonia in AIDS is caused by typical organisms like Streptococcus pneumoniae.</li>
                    <li>TMP-SMX prevents PCP (CD4 <200) and toxoplasmosis (CD4 <100); clarithromycin/azithromycin prevents MAC (CD4 <50).</li>
                    <li>HAART reduces viral replication but should not be started during acute illness due to IRIS.</li>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>A 58-year-old man with chronic stable angina, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension presents with severe left calf and foot pain, numbness, and inability to move toes. He has a history of progressive claudication, now with rest pain, pallor, and absent left pedal pulses.</p>

                    <li>What is the next step?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Answers</h3>
                <p><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Acute limb ischemia, likely thrombotic arterial occlusion or embolism.<br>
                <strong>Next step:</strong> Angiogram of the lower extremity.</p>
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand the clinical presentation of atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and acute limb ischemia.</li>
                    <li>Know the evaluation and medical management of PVD.</li>
                    <li>Understand indications for extremity revascularization.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Considerations</h4>
                <p>The patient has systemic atherosclerosis (angina, carotid bruit). Progressive claudication and recent rest pain suggest critical limb ischemia. Sudden pain, pallor, and pulselessness indicate acute arterial occlusion, possibly from an embolus or thrombosis, requiring urgent imaging for revascularization planning.</p>
                <h3>Approach to Peripheral Vascular Disease</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI):</strong> Ratio of ankle to brachial systolic blood pressure, measured by Doppler ultrasound.</li>
                    <li><strong>Claudication:</strong> Pain or cramp in muscles during exertion, relieved by rest.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>PVD affects up to 16% of Americans over 55, with smoking and diabetes as key risk factors. Claudication is the hallmark symptom, with pain distal to arterial stenosis. Physical exam may show diminished pulses, bruits, pallor on elevation, or rubor on dependency. ABI (normal >1, claudication 0.41-0.90, critical ischemia ≤0.40) confirms diagnosis. Management includes smoking cessation, exercise, and medications (e.g., cilostazol). Revascularization is indicated for critical ischemia (ABI <0.40, rest pain, nonhealing ulcers). Acute occlusion requires immediate anticoagulation and angiography.</p>

                </ul>
                <h4>Considerations</h4>
                <p>Severe hypertension (stage II, >160/100 mm Hg) with end-organ damage (retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy) warrants immediate two-drug therapy. Essential hypertension is likely, but secondary causes (e.g., renal artery stenosis) should be considered.</p>
                <h3>Approach to Hypertension</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Essential Hypertension:</strong> Idiopathic hypertension (80-95% of cases).</li>
                    <li><strong>Lifestyle Modification:</strong> Includes exercise, weight loss, reduced salt, and fat intake.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prehypertension:</strong> BP 120-139/80-89 mm Hg.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stage I Hypertension:</strong> BP 140-159/90-99 mm Hg.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stage II Hypertension:</strong> BP >160/100 mm Hg.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary Hypertension:</strong> Hypertension with a known cause (5-20% of cases).</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>Stage hypertension using multiple BP readings. Evaluate for secondary causes (renal, endocrine, etc.) in young patients, refractory cases, or with suggestive signs. Assess cardiovascular risk factors and target organ damage (cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, retinopathy). Start lifestyle modifications for all; stage I requires one drug, stage II requires two. Thiazides are first-line for uncomplicated hypertension per JNC 7. Tailor therapy to comorbidities (e.g., ACE inhibitors for diabetes).</p>

            <div class="case-content">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>A 39-year-old man with recent hypertension diagnosis presents with confusion, BP 215/132 mm Hg, tachycardia, diaphoresis, dilated pupils, and papilledema. He reports intermittent headaches, palpitations, and lightheadedness. He recently switched from clonidine to metoprolol. CT head and CSF studies rule out hemorrhage or infection.</p>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the most likely diagnosis?</li>
                    <li>What is the underlying etiology?</li>
                    <li>What is the next step?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Answers</h3>
                <p><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Hypertensive encephalopathy.<br>
                <strong>Possible etiology:</strong> Pheochromocytoma, possible clonidine rebound hypertension.<br>
                <strong>Next step:</strong> Admit to ICU, lower BP with parenteral agent, and monitor arterial pressure.</p>
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn definitions and management of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies.</li>
                    <li>Understand systemic BP and cerebral blood flow relationship.</li>
                    <li>Know diagnosis and treatment of pheochromocytoma.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Considerations</h4>
                <p>Severe hypertension with confusion suggests hypertensive encephalopathy, a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out stroke or infection. Urgent BP reduction is needed, but not to normal levels to avoid hypoperfusion. The hyperadrenergic state (tachycardia, diaphoresis, tremor) suggests pheochromocytoma or clonidine rebound.</p>
                <h3>Approach to Hypertensive Emergencies</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>MEN IIA:</strong> Multiple endocrine neoplasia with pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid cancer, and hyperparathyroidism.</li>
                    <li><strong>MEN IIB:</strong> Pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid cancer, and mucosal neuromas.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>Hypertensive emergencies involve end-organ damage (e.g., encephalopathy, myocardial ischemia, aortic dissection) and require immediate BP reduction with IV medications in the ICU. Urgencies lack end-organ damage and can be managed outpatient. Cerebral autoregulation fails at high BPs, causing edema and encephalopathy. Sodium nitroprusside is commonly used, but specific therapies (e.g., beta-blockers for dissection) are tailored. Pheochromocytoma is diagnosed with urine/plasma metanephrines and treated with alpha-blockade before surgery.</p>

            <h2>Case 11: Acute Viral Hepatitis, Possible Acetaminophen Hepatotoxicity</h2>
            <div class="case-content">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>A 28-year-old man presents with 5 days of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever (101°F), and myalgias. He has 12 lifetime sexual partners and takes acetaminophen (30 tablets/day for 2 days). He is jaundiced, with tender hepatomegaly, elevated transaminases (ALT 3440 IU/L, AST 2705 IU/L), bilirubin (24.5 mg/dL), and prolonged prothrombin time (14 seconds).</p>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the most likely diagnosis?</li>
                    <li>What is the most important immediate diagnostic test?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Answers</h3>
                <p><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Acute hepatitis, possibly viral or toxic, exacerbated by acetaminophen.<br>
                <strong>Most important test:</strong> Acetaminophen level to assess toxicity risk.</p>
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand viral serologic studies for hepatitis A, B, and C.</li>
                    <li>Know prognosis for acute viral hepatitis and recognize fulminant hepatic failure.</li>
                    <li>Understand hepatitis A and B prevention measures.</li>
                    <li>Know acetaminophen nomogram and hepatotoxicity treatment.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Considerations</h4>
                <p>Acute hepatic injury with systemic symptoms predates acetaminophen use, suggesting viral hepatitis or toxic injury. Sexual history raises hepatitis B/C risk. High transaminases (>1000 IU/L) indicate significant necrosis. Acetaminophen level is critical due to treatable toxicity risk.</p>
                <h3>Approach to Suspected Hepatitis</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hepatitis:</strong> Liver inflammation, often viral (A, B, C, D, E, G).</li>
                    <li><strong>Chronic Hepatitis:</strong> Liver inflammation/necrosis for ≥6 months, commonly with hepatitis B, C, D.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>Acute viral hepatitis presents with prodrome (fever, nausea, myalgias) and jaundice. Hepatitis A and E are fecal-oral; B and C are parenteral; D requires B coinfection. Most cases resolve, but fulminant failure (rapid encephalopathy, coagulopathy) is fatal without transplant. Serologic tests (e.g., anti-HAV IgM, HBsAg, anti-HCV) confirm etiology. Acetaminophen toxicity requires nomogram-guided N-acetylcysteine within 10 hours. Vaccines prevent hepatitis A and B; no prophylaxis exists for C.</p>

                    <li>Toxin/drug injury is the most common cause of acute hepatic failure.</li>
                    <li>Most acute hepatitis B cases recover; 5-10% become chronic.</li>
                    <li>Hepatitis B vaccination produces HBsAb; anti-HBc IgG indicates prior infection.</li>
                    <li>Hepatitis B prevention includes vaccine or HBIg; no prophylaxis for hepatitis C.</li>

            <h2>Case 12: Oligomenorrhea Caused by Hypothyroidism and Hyperprolactinemia</h2>
            <div class="case-content">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>A 38-year-old woman presents with oligomenorrhea progressing to secondary amenorrhea and galactorrhea. She has a history of regular menses, three uncomplicated pregnancies, and a bilateral tubal ligation. She reports weight gain, fatigue, mild hair thinning, and coarse skin texture over the past year. She denies headaches or visual changes. Physical examination is normal except for slight whitish nipple discharge. Pregnancy test is negative.</p>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the most likely diagnosis?</li>
                    <li>What is the most likely etiology for the condition?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Answers</h3>
                <p><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Oligomenorrhea and galactorrhea due to hypothyroidism.<br>
                <strong>Most likely etiology:</strong> Hypothyroidism, likely causing hyperprolactinemia, in a patient with previously normal menses, weight gain, fatigue, and hair thinning.</p>
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand the differential diagnosis of secondary amenorrhea and the approach to investigating hormonal causes.</li>
                    <li>Understand the interactions of hormones in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.</li>
                    <li>Recognize the clinical features and diagnostic evaluation of hypothyroidism.</li>
                    <li>Be familiar with the treatment of hypothyroidism.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Considerations</h4>
                <p>The patient’s secondary amenorrhea, galactorrhea, fatigue, weight gain, and hair loss suggest hypothyroidism. The absence of myxedema, bradycardia, or abnormal reflexes indicates mild disease. Lack of virilization or obesity makes polycystic ovarian syndrome less likely. Hypothyroidism may cause hyperprolactinemia, but prolactinomas must be excluded.</p>
                <h3>Approach to Oligomenorrhea</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Amenorrhea:</strong> Primary—absence of menarche by age 16; Secondary—absence of menstruation for ≥3 months in women with prior normal menses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Galactorrhea:</strong> Discharge of milk-containing fluid from the breast, may be unilateral or bilateral, clear, milky, or bloody.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oligomenorrhea:</strong> Menses at intervals >40 days or fewer than nine per year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome:</strong> Syndrome with infertility, hirsutism, obesity, amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea, and insulin resistance.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>Exclude pregnancy with serum beta-hCG. Evaluate secondary amenorrhea by assessing hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis disorders, which cause most cases. Hypothalamic issues (e.g., stress, weight loss, exercise) are common (>45%), followed by polycystic ovarian syndrome (30%) and pituitary disorders (18%), including prolactinomas. Hypothyroidism increases TRH, stimulating prolactin and causing galactorrhea and amenorrhea. Measure TSH and prolactin; if prolactin is >200 μg/L, consider MRI for prolactinoma. Other causes include ovarian failure, Sheehan syndrome, or adrenal hyperplasia.</p>

            <div class="case-content">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>A 49-year-old woman presents with progressive abdominal swelling and discomfort for 4 weeks. She has a history of blood transfusion and remote cocaine use. Examination shows fever (100.3°F), icteric sclerae, and ascites (shifting dullness, fluid wave). Labs reveal hyponatremia (Na 129 mEq/L), hypoalbuminemia (2.8 g/dL), prolonged prothrombin time (15 s), macrocytic anemia (hemoglobin 12 g/dL, MCV 102 fL), and thrombocytopenia (78,000/mm³).</p>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the most likely diagnosis?</li>
                    <li>What is your next step?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Answers</h3>
                <p><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Ascites due to portal hypertension from hepatic cirrhosis.<br>
                <strong>Next step:</strong> Paracentesis to evaluate ascitic fluid for etiology and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).</p>
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Know the causes of chronic hepatitis, especially hepatitis C virus (HCV).</li>
                    <li>Learn complications of chronic hepatitis, such as cirrhosis and portal hypertension.</li>
                    <li>Understand the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) to differentiate ascites causes.</li>
                    <li>Know how to diagnose spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Considerations</h4>
                <p>Ascites and jaundice suggest cirrhosis, likely hepatitis C-related due to transfusion history. Low-grade fever and tenderness raise concern for SBP. Hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathy indicate advanced liver disease. Paracentesis is needed to confirm portal hypertension (SAAG >1.1 g/dL) and rule out infection or malignancy.</p>
                <h3>Approach to Chronic Hepatitis</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ascites:</strong> Abnormal peritoneal fluid accumulation (>25 mL).</li>
                    <li><strong>Chronic Hepatitis:</strong> Hepatic inflammation and necrosis for ≥6 months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cirrhosis:</strong> Irreversible hepatic injury with fibrosis and regenerative nodules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Portal Hypertension:</strong> Portal vein pressure gradient >10 mm Hg, usually from cirrhosis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis:</strong> Bacterial infection of ascitic fluid without intra-abdominal source.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>Chronic hepatitis is diagnosed with elevated transaminases for ≥6 months, often due to hepatitis B/C, alcohol, autoimmune hepatitis, or metabolic disorders (hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, α1-antitrypsin deficiency). Hepatitis C is acquired via blood exposure (e.g., transfusion, IV drug use). Test with anti-HCV Ab or HCV RNA PCR. Cirrhosis complications include portal hypertension (varices, ascites, encephalopathy), treated with beta-blockers, octreotide, or TIPS. Ascites management involves sodium restriction and diuretics. SBP diagnosis requires >250 neutrophils/mm³ in ascitic fluid; treat with IV antibiotics.</p>

            <h2>Case 14: Pancreatitis, Gallstones</h2>
            <div class="case-content">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>A 42-year-old Hispanic woman presents with 24 hours of severe epigastric pain radiating to her back, nausea, and vomiting. She has a history of similar but milder episodes after heavy meals. She is afebrile, tachycardic (104 bpm), with scleral icterus and epigastric tenderness. Labs show elevated bilirubin (9.2 g/dL), alkaline phosphatase (285 IU/L), transaminases (AST 78 IU/L, ALT 92 IU/L), amylase (1249 IU/L), and leukocytosis (16,500/mm³).</p>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the most likely diagnosis?</li>
                    <li>What is the most likely underlying etiology?</li>
                    <li>What is your next diagnostic step?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Answers</h3>
                <p><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Acute pancreatitis.<br>
                <strong>Most likely etiology:</strong> Choledocholithiasis (common bile duct stone).<br>
                <strong>Next diagnostic step:</strong> Right-upper quadrant abdominal ultrasonography.</p>
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Know the causes, clinical features, and prognostic factors in acute pancreatitis.</li>
                    <li>Learn the principles of treatment and complications of acute pancreatitis.</li>
                    <li>Know the complications of gallstones.</li>
                    <li>Understand the medical treatment of biliary sepsis and indications for ERCP or surgical intervention.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Considerations</h4>
                <p>The patient’s severe epigastric pain, nausea, and elevated amylase suggest acute pancreatitis. Prior milder episodes indicate biliary colic, and hyperbilirubinemia suggests common bile duct obstruction by a gallstone. She has one Ranson criterion (leukocytosis), indicating a likely non-severe course manageable on a hospital ward.</p>
                <h3>Approach to Acute Pancreatitis</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Acute Pancreatitis:</strong> Inflammatory process with pancreatic enzyme autodigestion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pancreatic Pseudocyst:</strong> Cystic space in the pancreas without epithelial lining, often with chronic pancreatitis.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>Common causes include gallstones (30-60%), alcohol (15-30%), and hypertriglyceridemia. Pancreatitis presents with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, worsened by food, with nausea and vomiting. Elevated amylase and lipase confirm diagnosis; lipase is more specific. CT imaging detects complications. Treatment involves NPO status, IV fluids, and analgesia. ERCP within 72 hours may remove bile duct stones. Ranson criteria predict severity; ≥3 criteria suggest pancreatic necrosis.</p>

            <h2>Case 15: Syncope—Heart Block</h2>
            <div class="case-content">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>A 72-year-old man presents after fainting in church, with 2-3 minutes of unconsciousness. His wife reports recent exercise intolerance and presyncopal symptoms. He is bradycardic (35 bpm) with third-degree AV block on ECG. Examination shows contusions but no focal deficits. Labs are normal, with negative cardiac enzymes.</p>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the most likely diagnosis?</li>
                    <li>What is your next step?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Answers</h3>
                <p><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Syncope due to third-degree AV block.<br>
                <strong>Next step:</strong> Place temporary transcutaneous or transvenous pacemaker and evaluate for permanent pacemaker.</p>
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Know the major causes of syncope and historical clues to diagnosis.</li>
                    <li>Understand the basic evaluation of syncope based on history.</li>
                    <li>Recognize vasovagal syncope and carotid sinus hypersensitivity.</li>
                    <li>Diagnose and manage first-, second-, and third-degree AV block.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Considerations</h4>
                <p>The syncopal episode and bradycardia suggest third-degree AV block, likely from conduction system disease or myocardial infarction. The low heart rate (<40 bpm) and widened QRS indicate a block below the AV node, necessitating a pacemaker. Rule out myocardial infarction or structural heart issues.</p>
                <h3>Approach to Syncope</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Syncope:</strong> Transient loss of consciousness and postural tone with spontaneous recovery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vasovagal Syncope:</strong> Fainting due to excessive vagal tone causing hypotension without appropriate heart rate or vasomotor response.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>Syncope results from transient cerebral hypoperfusion. Common causes include vasovagal (most common in young, healthy individuals), orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac issues (arrhythmias, outflow obstruction). History is key; vasovagal syncope has prodromal symptoms (nausea, diaphoresis) and triggers (stress, pain). Orthostatic hypotension involves positional changes. Cardiac causes include bradyarrhythmias (e.g., third-degree AV block) or structural issues (e.g., aortic stenosis). ECG, Holter monitoring, or electrophysiologic studies may be needed. Pacemakers are indicated for symptomatic bradyarrhythmias or third-degree block.</p>

                    <li>What is your next step?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Answers</h3>
                <p><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Colitis, probably ulcerative colitis.<br>
                <strong>Next step:</strong> Admit to hospital, obtain stool samples to exclude infection, and start corticosteroids.</p>
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Know the typical presentation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</li>
                    <li>Know the differences between Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.</li>
                    <li>Know the treatment of IBD.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Considerations</h4>
                <p>The chronicity, bloody diarrhea, and colonic dilatation suggest ulcerative colitis over infectious colitis. Absence of travel or sick contacts supports IBD. No signs of perforation or toxic megacolon are present, but close monitoring is needed.</p>
                <h3>Approach to Colitis</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Colitis:</strong> Inflammation of the colon from infectious, autoimmune, ischemic, or idiopathic causes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inflammatory Bowel Disease:</strong> Autoimmune intestinal inflammation, primarily Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>Differentiate IBD (ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease) from infectious, ischemic, or radiation colitis. Ulcerative colitis involves the rectum and extends proximally continuously, causing bloody diarrhea. Crohn disease affects any GI segment, often the terminal ileum, with skip lesions and complications like fistulas. Diagnosis is confirmed by colonoscopy with biopsy. Treatment includes 5-ASA compounds (e.g., mesalamine) for mild disease, corticosteroids for moderate-severe disease, and immunomodulators (e.g., infliximab) for refractory cases. Surgery is curative for ulcerative colitis but not Crohn disease.</p>

            <h2>Case 23: Alcoholic Ketoacidosis</h2>
            <div class="case-content">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>A 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse is brought to the emergency room with nausea and vomiting after a prolonged drinking binge. His physical examination is significant only for tachycardia and mild epigastric tenderness. His lab studies are most significant for a low serum bicarbonate level, suggestive of an acidotic state. The Acetest is weakly positive for ketones, but his serum glucose is not elevated.</p>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the most likely diagnosis?</li>
                    <li>What is the best initial treatment?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Answers</h3>
                <p><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Alcoholic ketoacidosis.<br>
                <strong>Best initial treatment:</strong> Infusion of 5% dextrose with 0.9% saline.</p>
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand how to diagnose and classify simple acid-base disorders.</li>
                    <li>Know how to calculate the anion gap (AG), and how to manage the causes of high AG acidosis.</li>
                    <li>Understand the two causes of nongap acidosis (bicarbonate losses from the GI tract and renal tubular acidosis).</li>
                    <li>Understand how to discriminate between saline-responsive and saline-resistant metabolic alkalosis.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Considerations</h4>
                <p>The most significant finding in this case is an apparent acidosis with an elevated anion gap. In this patient with a history of alcoholism and an alcohol binge, alcoholic ketoacidosis is most likely, but one must also consider the possibility of other ingestions (methanol, ethylene glycol), either accidental or intentional, that would also present with similar laboratory findings, but may be more serious or even fatal.</p>
                <h3>Approach to Alcoholic Ketoacidosis</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Anion gap (AG):</strong> [Na⁺] – [Cl⁻ + HCO3⁻]. An estimation of unmeasured anions in the plasma (phosphate, sulfate, organic acids).</li>
                    <li><strong>Osmolal gap:</strong> The difference between the measured and calculated serum osmolality. If elevated (e.g., >10 mOsm), then suggestive of the presence of significant serum concentration of an additional osmotically active solute such as methanol or ethylene glycol.</li>
                    <li><strong>Urine anion gap (UAG):</strong> Urine [Na⁺ + K⁺] – urine [Cl⁻]. An estimation of urinary ammonium ion (NH4⁺) excretion.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>In normal physiology, systemic pH is maintained between 7.35 and 7.45. The main homeostatic mechanisms are respiratory and renal. Disturbances in one system cause compensatory changes in the other. Simple acid-base disorders can be classified using pH, PaCO2, and HCO3⁻. For metabolic acidosis, calculate the anion gap (AG). Causes of high AG metabolic acidosis include lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, toxins (methanol, ethylene glycol), and renal failure. In alcoholic ketoacidosis, decreased carbohydrate intake and alcohol-induced inhibition of gluconeogenesis lead to increased ketoacid formation, predominantly β-hydroxybutyrate. Treatment involves dextrose and saline to increase insulin secretion and replenish fluid deficits. Thiamine should be administered prior to glucose to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy. Suspect methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion if there is a high osmolal gap and low ethanol levels; treat with fomepizole. Non-AG acidosis may result from GI bicarbonate losses or renal tubular acidosis (RTA), assessed via urine anion gap. Respiratory acidosis and alkalosis are caused by changes in ventilation, while metabolic alkalosis involves acid loss or HCO3⁻ retention, classified as saline-responsive or saline-resistant based on urine chloride levels.</p>

            <h2>Case 24: Low Back Pain</h2>
            <div class="case-content">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>An obese 35-year-old woman with acute worsening of chronic low back pain complains of shooting pain down her right leg. Her physical examination is normal except for a positive straight leg raise test on the right.</p>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is your diagnosis?</li>
                    <li>What is your next step?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Answers</h3>
                <p><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Musculoskeletal low back pain, possible sciatica without neurologic deficits.<br>
                <strong>Next step:</strong> Encourage continuation of usual activity, avoiding twisting motions or heavy lifting. Use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on a scheduled basis; you can also recommend muscle relaxants, although these drugs may cause sleepiness. Massage or physical therapy might be helpful. Follow-up in 4 weeks. Long-term advice includes weight loss and back-strengthening exercises.</p>
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn the history and physical examination findings that help to distinguish benign musculoskeletal low back pain from more serious causes of low back pain.</li>
                    <li>Understand the variety of treatment options and their effectiveness in low back pain.</li>
                    <li>Learn the judicious use of laboratory and imaging tests in evaluating low back pain.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Considerations</h4>
                <p>This young patient with chronic back pain has an acute exacerbation with pain radiating down her leg, which may indicate possible sciatic nerve compression. She has no other neurologic abnormalities, such as sensory deficits, motor weakness, or “red flag” symptoms of more serious etiologies of back pain, which if present would demand a more urgent evaluation. Thus, this individual has a good prognosis for recovery with conservative therapy, perhaps time being the most important factor. If she does not improve after 6 weeks, then imaging studies can be considered.</p>
                <h3>Approach to Low Back Pain</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cauda Equina Syndrome:</strong> Lower back pain, saddle anesthesia, and bowel or bladder dysfunction with possible lower extremity weakness and loss of reflexes caused by compression of multiple sacral nerve roots. Cauda equina syndrome is a surgical emergency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sciatica:</strong> Pain in the distribution of the lumbar or sacral nerve roots, with or without motor or sensory deficits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spondylolisthesis:</strong> Anterior displacement of an upper vertebral body on the lower body, which can cause symptoms and signs of spinal stenosis. This condition can result from spondylolysis or from degenerative disk disease in the elderly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spondylolysis:</strong> Defect in the pars interarticularis, either congenital or secondary to a stress fracture, leading to lower back pain, back muscle spasms, or no symptoms.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>Low back pain affects two-thirds of adults at some point, most commonly between ages 30 and 60. It is recurrent, often mild in younger patients, resolving within 2 weeks, but can be more severe with age. Clinicians must exclude serious conditions like malignancy, infection, or neurologic processes (e.g., cauda equina syndrome). Most cases are idiopathic musculoskeletal low back pain, managed conservatively, with 90% resolving in 4-6 weeks. “Red flag” symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss, neurologic deficits) necessitate urgent evaluation. Imaging is reserved for persistent pain (>4-6 weeks), suspected malignancy, or infection. Treatment includes NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and maintaining activity; bed rest is not recommended. Surgery is considered for persistent radicular pain or neurologic deficits.</p>

                    <li>Pain that interferes with sleep, significant unintentional weight loss, or fever suggests an infectious or neoplastic cause of back pain.</li>
                    <li>Imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging, are useful only if surgery is being considered (persistent pain and neurologic symptoms after 4 to 6 weeks of conservative care in patients with herniated disks) or if a neoplastic or infectious cause of back pain is being considered.</li>

            <div class="case-content">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>A healthy 52-year-old man complains of a 4- to 5-month history of increasing exercise intolerance, but he denies orthopnea, PND, edema, or other signs of heart failure. The patient uses a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) regularly. He has not had any overt gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss. On examination, he weighs 205 lb, and he has slight pallor of the conjunctiva, skin, and palms. He is anemic, with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL.</p>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the most likely diagnosis?</li>
                    <li>What is your next diagnostic step?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Answers</h3>
                <p><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Iron-deficiency anemia as a result of chronic blood loss.<br>
                <strong>Next diagnostic step:</strong> Analyze the complete blood count (CBC), particularly the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), to determine if the anemia is microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic; assess the leukocyte count and platelet count.</p>
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand that iron-deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia.</li>
                    <li>Know the diagnostic approach to anemia.</li>
                    <li>Be familiar with the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Considerations</h4>
                <p>This 52-year-old man presents with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion for a few months. His physical examination is significant only for pallor. The serum hemoglobin level confirms anemia. The next step would be to characterize the anemia as microcytic, consistent with iron deficiency, and confirm with further testing for total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and ferritin. The most likely source of blood loss in male patients is the GI tract; therefore, finding iron-deficiency anemia should suggest a possible GI source of bleeding, with colon cancer the most serious possibility. This patient is using an NSAID, which may predispose to erosive gastritis. Once iron-deficiency anemia is confirmed, a thorough evaluation of the GI tract, including upper and lower endoscopy, is needed.</p>
                <h3>Approach to Suspected Iron-Deficiency Anemia</h3>
                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Anemia:</strong> Decreased red blood cell (RBC) mass, leading to less oxygen-carrying capacity. Hemoglobin levels less than 13 g/dL in men and less than 12 g/dL in women are generally used.</li>
                    <li><strong>Iron Studies:</strong> Ferritin is a marker of iron stores, but it also is an acute-phase reactant, decreased in iron deficiency but increased with inflammatory chronic diseases. The TIBC is an indirect measure of transferrin saturation levels and is increased in iron deficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):</strong> Average RBC volume. This offers a method of categorizing anemias as microcytic (MCV <80 fL), normocytic (MCV 80-100 fL), and macrocytic (MCV >100 fL).</li>
                    <li><strong>Reticulocyte:</strong> New RBC that usually is 1 to 1.5 days old.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reticulocyte Count:</strong> Fraction of RBCs consisting of reticulocytes that indirectly indicates the bone marrow activity of the erythrocyte line. It usually is expressed as a percentage and normally is 1%; corrected reticulocyte count accounts for anemia.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Clinical Approach</h4>
                <p>Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in the United States, primarily due to blood loss (e.g., GI bleeding in men, menstrual loss in women). Iron is essential for hemoglobin synthesis. Initial evaluation involves CBC with MCV to classify anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic. Iron deficiency typically presents as microcytic anemia with high RDW. Iron studies (low ferritin, high TIBC, low transferrin saturation) confirm the diagnosis. Treatment involves oral ferrous sulfate (325 mg two or three times daily) for 6 months to replenish stores, with endoscopic evaluation to identify GI bleeding sources, especially in men or postmenopausal women. Symptoms include fatigue, dyspnea, and sometimes pica or pagophagia. Severe cases may show glossitis, cheilosis, or koilonychia.</p>

                <h3>Clinical Pearls</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Anemia is a clinical finding, not a diagnosis, and requires investigation to determine the underlying etiology.</li>
                    <li>Iron-deficiency anemia in men or postmenopausal women is primarily a result of gastrointestinal blood losses; therefore, finding iron-deficiency anemia in this patient population warrants a thorough gastrointestinal workup.</li>
                    <li>Iron-deficiency anemia in women of reproductive age is most often caused by menstrual blood loss.</li>
                    <li>Fecal occult blood testing is negative in approximately 50% of patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Therefore, a negative fecal occult blood test in the presence of iron-deficiency anemia should not discourage pursuing a thorough gastrointestinal workup.</li>
                    <li>The mean corpuscular volume, red blood cell distribution width, and reticulocyte index are important parameters in the evaluation of anemia.</li>
                </ul>
